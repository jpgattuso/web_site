 abstract = {The effects of elevated partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and temperature, alone and in 
combination, on survival, calciﬁcation and dissolution were investigated in the crustose 
coralline alga Lithophyllum cabiochae. Algae were maintained in aquaria during 1 year at 
near-ambient conditions of irradiance, at ambient or elevated temperature (1 3 1C) and at 
ambient [ca. 400 parts per million (ppm)] or elevated pCO2 (ca. 700 ppm). Algal necroses 
appeared at the end of summer under elevated temperature ﬁrst at 700 ppm (60% of the 
thallus surface) and then at 400 ppm (30%). The death of algae was observed only under 
elevated temperature and was two- to threefold higher under elevated pCO2. During the 
ﬁrst month of the experiment, net calciﬁcation was signiﬁcantly reduced under elevated 
pCO2. At the end of the summer period, net calciﬁcation decreased by 50% when both 
temperature and pCO2 were elevated while no effect was found under elevated tem- 
perature and elevated pCO2 alone. In autumn and winter, net calciﬁcation in healthy 
algae increased with increasing temperature, independently of the pCO2 level, while 
necroses and death in the algal population caused a net dissolution at elevated 
temperature and pCO2. The dissolution of dead algal thalli was affected by elevated 
pCO2, being two- to fourfold higher than under ambient pCO2. These results suggest that 
net dissolution is likely to exceed net calciﬁcation in L. cabiochae by the end of this 
century. This could have major consequences in terms of biodiversity and biogeochem- 
istry in coralligenous communities dominated by these algae.},
