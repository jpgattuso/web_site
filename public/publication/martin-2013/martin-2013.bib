 abstract = {Primary production and calcification responses to irradiance were investigated in Lithophyllum cabiochae, a crustose coralline alga from Mediterranean coralligenous communities, collected at ca. 25 m depth in the Bay of Villefranche. Algae were maintained in aquaria at temperature and irradiance levels close to in situ conditions. Physiological measurements were performed using incubation chambers in the dark and in the light at different irradiance levels in the range of those measured in situ. Both photosynthesis and calcification rates in L. cabiochae were strongly related to irradiance. Dark respiration averaged 0.2-0.3 μmol cm-2 thallus h-1 in terms of both O
consumption and CO2 release and maximal gross photosynthesis averaged 1.0 μmol cm-
2 h-1 in terms of both O2 production and CO2 uptake. Mean rate of net calcification was

in the light. Diel net and gross organic C productions were estimated to 3 and 7 μmol C cm-2 thallus d-1, respectively. Diel net inorganic C production was estimated to 3 μmol CaCO3 cm-2 thallus d-1. Despite the low light conditions experienced by the algae at ca. 25 m depth, L. cabiochae can be considered as a major contributor to primary productivity and calcium carbonate deposition, making coralligenous communities a major carbon and
carbonate producer in the Mediterranean Sea.},
