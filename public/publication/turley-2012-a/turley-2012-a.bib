 abstract = {Anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere and subsequent uptake by the ocean are changing seawater chemistry, a process known as ocean acidification. Research indicates that as ocean acidification continues, reflecting increasing CO2 emissions, it is likely that although some species will be tolerant it will impact many marine organisms and processes, including composition of communities and food webs. While there may be local actions to limit acidification from local sources the root cause of ocean acidification, CO2 emissions, is a global issue requiring global action through United Nations bodies.},
