 abstract = {This paper describes a closed-chamber method for measuring CO2 fluxes in intertidal soft sediments during periods of emersion. The method relies on closed-circuit incubations of undisturbed sediment and measurement of CO2 exchanges using an infrared gas analyser. The method was assessed during field experiments, both in light and dark conditions, on an exposed sandy beach and in an estuary. The rates of gross community production measured under moderate diance (4.2 mg C m(-2) h(-1) on the exposed sandy beach and 35 mg C m(-2) h(-1) in the estuary) are in good agreement with rates reported in the literature. In conjunction with appropriate sampling strategies, this method can be useful for estimating and comparing production of intertidal areas or for assessing factors that influence production.},
