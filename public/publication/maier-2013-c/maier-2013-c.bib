 abstract = {Ocean acidification caused by anthropogenic uptake of CO2 is perceived to be a major threat to calcifying organisms. Cold-water corals were thought to be strongly affected by a decrease in ocean pH due to their abundance in deep and cold waters which, in contrast to tropical coral reef waters, will soon become corrosive to calcium carbonate. Calcification rates of two Mediterranean cold- water coral species, L. pertusa and M. oculata, were studied under variable CO2 concentrations that ranged between 380 μatm for present-day conditions and 930 μatm which is slightly above the pCO2 value projected for the end of the century. The present study addressed both short- and long- term responses by repeatedly determining calcification rates over a period of 9 months. Besides studying the direct, short-term response the study aimed at elucidating on the potential for acclimation of cold-water corals to ocean acidification. Net calcification of both species was unaffected by the levels of pCO2 investigated and revealed no short-term shock and, therefore, no long-term acclimation to changes in the carbonate chemistry. The use of proper control conditions revealed that increasing calcification rates over time were not caused by acclimation to higher pCO2 but that they had to be attributed to other factors either related to general aquarium maintenance or related to coral biology and functioning.},
