 abstract = {This study investigated the effect of light on the short-term metabolic fate of I4C-bicarbo- nate in zooxanthellae and animal tissue of the coral Stylophora pistillata (Esper, 1797)and on the spe- cific activity of host enzymes involved in the metabolism of carbon. Short-term incubations of coral col- onies were carned out In sltu at Bowl Reef (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) at depths of 5 and 30 m to measure rates of oxygen production and consumption and rates of 14Cflxation Short-term 14Cincuba- tion experiments were also carried out under controlled conditions In the laboratory. Additional sam- ples were collected from 5, 10, 15 and 20 m at Chicken Reef (GBR) to determne the specific enzyme act~vityof coral tlssues from different depths in the water column Light and depth both affected the distribution of â€˜vanlong photosynthetic products but neither affected translocation rate measured by the In vlvo method (60.4%).The majority of the I4Clabel was recovered in lipid (33to 94 %) and water- soluble fractions (5to 67 The zooxanthellae incorporated more 14Cinto lipids than into water- soluble compounds (88to 94 % vs 4 to 7 %) whlle the animal exhibited higher I4Clevels in water-solu- ble compounds than In lipids (44 to 67 % vs 33 to 56 %). Algal fractions showed decreased I4Cincorpo- ration into lipids and increased I4Cincorporation into water-soluble compounds with increasing depth or decreasing irradiance. The spec~flcactivlty of 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase increased with depth supporting the hypothesis that lipids are being catabolized more rapidly at greater depths Citrate synthase and hexokinase activities also decreased with depth The decrease in cytochrome oxidase act~vitywlth depth 1s consistent with a concomitant decrease in respirat~onas depth increases. These results confirm that the carbon cycling In S. plstlllata is partially dependent on light.},
