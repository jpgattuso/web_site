 abstract = {A coral reef represents the net accumulation of CaCO3 produced by corals and other calcifying organisms. If calcification declines, then reef-building capacity also declines. Coral reef calcification depends on the saturation state of the carbonate mineral aragonite of surface waters. By the middle of next century, increased CO2 concentration will decrease aragonite saturation state in the tropics by 30%, and biogenic aragonite precipitation by 14â€“30%. Coral reefs are particularly threatened, since reef-building organisms secrete metastable forms of CaCO3, but the biogeochemical consequences on other calcifying marine ecosystems may be equally severe.},
