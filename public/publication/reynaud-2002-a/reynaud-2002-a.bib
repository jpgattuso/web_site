 abstract = {Experiments were performed to investigate the effect of feeding on the isotopic composition of zooxanthellae, animal tissue and skeleton of the coral Stylophora pistillata. Two sets of corals were grown with filtered seawater under high-light, controlled conditions. One group of corals was fed Artemia salina nauplii three times a week over twelve weeks, and compared to a control group that was not fed. Fed corals exhibited higher levels of chlorophyll and protein as well as higher calcification rates than starved colonies. The net photosynthetic rate was higher in starved than in fed corals, but the respiration rate was not different between the two treatments. d13C and d15N values of nauplii Artemia used for coral feeding were -12‰ and 6.6‰ respectively. d13C values of zooxanthellae were significantly heavier than those of coral tissues, for both fed (-10.1 vs. -11.7‰) and un-fed colonies (-10.9 vs. -13.2‰). Isotopic data reflected the incorporation of Artemia carbon into the coral tissue in that the d13C of host tissues was significantly heavier in fed than in un-fed colonies (-11.7 to -13.2‰ respectively), although there was less difference in the d13C of the zooxanthellae fraction between the two groups. In contract to carbon, d15N values were not significantly different between fed and starved colonies either in the host tissue (3.5‰), or in zooxanthellae (3.8‰). This suggests that even when fed, the coral relied on other sources of nitrogen such as the external dissolved inorganic nitrogen pool, and was able to conserve organic nitrogen efficiently between host and symbiont, at least under the high light conditions used here
Skeletal d13C signature was not significantly different between fed and unfed colonies (mean = –4.6‰). Skeletal d18O composition was however significantly different between the two treatments (-4.24 to -4.05‰ for fed and starved colonies respectively). A simple model is presented to summarize how various sources of carbon (inorganic, photosynthate and prey) flow through the coral colony and are reflected in isotopic signatures. The carbon isotopic signature of the coral tissue itself may be a useful index of relative use of prey and translocated carbon.},
