 abstract = {Agulhas rings provide the principal route for ocean waters to circulate from the Indo- Pacific to the Atlantic basin. Well known for their influence in global ocean circulation, their role in plankton transport is largely unknown. Here we combined hydrographic, optical and genetic sampling to show that the overall structure of plankton communities was continuous across the Agulhas choke point. However, intraspecific genetic diversity was extensively remodeled between Indian and Atlantic plankton populations. Direct in situ sampling of a young Agulhas ring indicated that strong vertical mixing within the rings drove complex nitrogen cycling, shaping community metabolism and biogeochemical signatures as plankton transited westwards. The special local environment observed inside a young Agulhas ring provides a selective mechanism explaining the limited dispersal of Indian Ocean plankton populations into the Atlantic.},
