 abstract = {Ocean acidification, due to anthropogenic CO2 absorption by the ocean, may have profound impacts on marine biota. Calcareous organisms are expected to be particularly sensitive due to the decreasing availability of carbonate ions driven by decreasing pH levels. Recently, some studies focused on the early life stages of molluscs that are supposedly more sensitive to environmental disturbances than adult stages. Although these studies have shown decreased growth rates and increased proportions of abnormal development under low pH conditions, they did not allow discriminating between the direct physiological impact of pH decrease alone and the impact on calcification resulting from aragonite undersaturation, on the larval development of these species. In the present study, we aim at assessing the impact of various modifications in the carbonate chemistry by manipulating separately pH and total alkalinity on the growth of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) larvae during the first 3 days of development (until shelled D-­‐veliger larvae). Results showed that the developmental success (percentage of eggs developing to a viable D-­‐veliger larvae) and growth rates were not directly affected by pH decreases but more likely by the associated decreases in aragonite saturation levels. In contrast to previous studies, both hatching and growth rates were not significantly altered as long as seawater remained saturated with respect to aragonite, and strongly decreased below saturation levels. These results suggest that the mechanisms potentially used by these organisms to regulate calcification rates are not efficient enough to cope for the low availability of carbonate ions under corrosive conditions.},
