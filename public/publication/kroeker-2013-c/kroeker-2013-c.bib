 abstract = {Ocean acidification represents a threat to marine species and ecosystems worldwide. Understanding the ecological impacts of acidification is a high priority for science, management, and policy. As research on the topic expands at an exponential rate, a comprehensive understanding of the generalities and/or variability in organismsâ€™ responses and corresponding levels of certainty is necessary to forecast the ecological effects. Here, we perform the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date by synthesizing the results of 228 studies examining the biological response to ocean acidification. The results reveal decreased survival, calcification, growth, reproduction and development in response to acidification across a broad range of marine organisms, as well as significant trait-mediated variation among taxonomic groups and life stages. In addition, the results reveal a pronounced sensitivity of calcifying algae and molluscs to acidification, especially among the early life stages of molluscs, and enhanced sensitivity to acidification when concurrently exposed to elevated seawater temperature across a diversity of organisms.},
