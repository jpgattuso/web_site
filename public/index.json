FOCE studies have been conducted across different marine benthic habitats and regions, from Antarctica to the tropics. Based on this previous research we have formed some core operating principles that will aid those embarking on future FOCE experiments. FOCE studies have potential to provide important insight into the effects of ocean acidification that can add to or refine conclusions drawn from laboratory or single species studies because they are conducted in situ on intact assemblages. Scaling up from sub-organismal and individual effects to also include indirect impacts on the ecosystem and ecosystem services, make FOCE experiments essential in filling in current knowledge gaps in our understanding of ocean acidification. While FOCE systems are complex, relatively costly, and somewhat difficult to operate, the challenges they pose are tractable and they have proven to be a useful approach in ocean acidification research. The aim of this paper is to draw from the experiences of past FOCE experiments and provide practical advice for designing, building and operating a FOCE experiment. Some of the most important recommendations include: field testing the system design; having a backup power supply; using replicate treatment enclosures; monitoring and maintaining the chemistry appropriately; allowing sufficient time to achieve near CO2 equilibrium conditions; and having a scientific focus with a core set of hypotheses. Future FOCE experiments could focus on longer durations, multiple factors, and testing more intact benthic marine communities and ecosystems. We hope this paper will encourage further FOCE deployments and experiments, as well as provide some guidelines to improve future FOCE studies and advance ocean acidification research.","tags":null,"title":"Free Ocean CO|2| Enrichment (FOCE) experiments: scientific and technical recommendations for future in situ ocean acidification projects","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536444000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536444000,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["HC Bittig","T Steinhoff","H Claustre","B Fiedler","NL Williams","R Sauzède","A Körtzinger","J-P Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514761200,"objectID":"a7b1e167890ee4a94418be42cb024fc0","permalink":"/publication/bittig-2018/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bittig-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"This work presents two new methods to estimate oceanic alkalinity (AT), dissolved inorganic carbon (CT), pH, and pCO2 from temperature, salinity, oxygen, and geolocation data. \"CANYON-B\" is a Bayesian neural network mapping that accurately reproduces GLODAPv2 bottle data and the biogeochemical relations contained therein. \"CONTENT\" combines and refines the four carbonate system variables to be consistent with carbonate chemistry. Both methods come with a robust uncertainty estimate that incorporates information from the local conditions. They are validated against independent GO-SHIP bottle and sensor data, and compare favorably to other state-of-the-art mapping methods. As \"dynamic climatologies\" they show comparable performance to classical climatologies on large scales but a much better representation on smaller scales (40–120 d, 500–1,500 km) compared to in situ data. The limits of these mappings are explored with pCO2 estimation in surface waters, i.e., at the edge of the domain with high intrinsic variability. In highly productive areas, there is a tendency for pCO2 overestimation due to decoupling of the O2 and C cycles by air-sea gas exchange, but global surface pCO2 estimates are unbiased compared to a monthly climatology. CANYON-B and CONTENT are highly useful as transfer functions between components of the ocean observing system (GO-SHIP repeat hydrography, BGC-Argo, underway observations) and permit the synergistic use of these highly complementary systems, both in spatial/temporal coverage and number of observations. Through easily and robotically-accessible observations they allow densification of more difficult-to-observe variables (e.g., 15 times denser AT and CT compared to direct measurements). At the same time, they give access to the complete carbonate system. This potential is demonstrated by an observation-based global analysis of the Revelle buffer factor, which shows a significant, high latitude-intensified increase between +0.1 and +0.4 units per decade. This shows the utility that such transfer functions with realistic uncertainty estimates provide to ocean biogeochemistry and global climate change research. In addition, CANYON-B provides robust and accurate estimates of nitrate, phosphate, and silicate.

A ten days incubation was performed, simulating the changes in temperature and pressure experienced in situ in the NW Mediterranean Sea. Aggregates sinking from 200m to 1700m depth (assuming an average sinking velocity of 150 m d-1) were exposed to a fresh natural mesopelagic prokaryotic community, with limited influence of culture-associated prokaryotes. E. huxleyi aggregates lipid composition revealed more degradation under increasing hydrostatic pressure (relative to constant atmospheric pressure), suggesting increased cell lysis. In parallel, changes in particulate inorganic carbon and total alkalinity indicated CaCO3 dissolution, potentially accelerated under pressure. However, increased hydrostatic pressure also had a positive effect on particle aggregation, which may compensate the effect of increased cell lysis. Our results imply that in coccolithophorid-dominated sinking aggregates, the ballasting and protection effects of coccoliths may collapse throughout the water column. The increase in aggregation potential with pressure observed in controlled conditions might balance the loss of mineral ballast to a certain extent, although this needs to be confirmed in situ.","tags":null,"title":"Biodegradation of Emiliania huxleyi aggregates by a natural Mediterranean prokaryotic community under increasing hydrostatic pressure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wolfgang Cramer","Joël Guiot","Marianela Fader","Joaquim Garrabou","Jean-Pierre Gattuso","Ana Iglesias","Manfred A.

Here, we contrast and compare different approaches to multiple driver experiments that aim to elucidate biological responses to a complex matrix of ocean global change. We present the benefits and the challenges of each approach with a focus on marine research, and guidelines to navigate through these different categories to help identify strategies that might best address research questions in fundamental physiology, experimental evolutionary biology, and community ecology. Our Review reveals that the field of multiple driver research is being pulled in complementary directions: the need for reductionist approaches to obtain process-oriented, mechanistic understanding, and a requirement to quantify responses to projected future scenarios of ocean change.

The importance of this variation in the context of ocean acidification requires knowing what aspect of variability biological processes respond to. We conducted four experiments (ranging from 3 to 22 days) with different variability regimes (pHT 7.4 – 8.1) assessing the impact of diel fluctuations in carbonate chemistry on the early development of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Larval shell growth was consistently correlated to mean exposures, regardless of variability regimes, indicating that calcification responds instantaneously to seawater chemistry. Larval development was impacted by timing of exposure, revealing sensitivity of two developmental processes: development of the shell field, and tran- sition from the first to the second larval shell. Fluorescent staining revealed developmental delay of the shell field at low pH, and abnormal development thereof was correlated with hinge defects in D-veligers. This study shows, for the first time, that ocean acidification affects larval soft-tissue development, independent from calcification. Multiple develop- mental processes additively underpin the teratogenic effect of ocean acidification on bivalve larvae. These results explain why trochophores are the most sensitive life-history stage in marine bivalves and suggest that short-term variability in carbonate chemistry can impact early larval development.","tags":null,"title":"Ocean pH fluctuations affect mussel larvae at key developmental transitions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J-P Gattuso","AK Magnan","L Bopp","WWL Cheung","CM Duarte","J Hinkel","E Mcleod","F Micheli","A Oschlies","P Williamson","R Billé","VI Chalastani","RD Gates","J-O Irisson","JJ Middelburg","H-O Pörtner","GH Rau"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514761200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514761200,"objectID":"a43bc9cca6cb315a7a5b6e4b113b3b95","permalink":"/publication/gattuso-2018-a/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gattuso-2018-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The Paris Agreement target of limiting global surface warming to 1.5-2°C compared to pre-industrial levels by 2100 will still heavily impact the ocean.

Although the procedure to propagate these uncertainties is well known, it has not been offered in public packages that compute marine carbonate chemistry, fundamental tools that are relied on by the community. To remedy this shortcoming, four of these packages were expanded to calculate sensitivities of computed variables with respect to each input variable and to use those sensitivities along with user-specified estimates of input uncertainties (standard uncertainties) to propagate uncertainties of calculated variables (combined standard uncertainties). Sensitivities from these packages agree with one another and with analytical solutions to within 0.01%; similar agreement among packages was found for the combined standard uncertainties. One package was used to quantify how propagated uncertainties vary among computed variables, seawater conditions, and the chosen pair of carbonate system variables that is used as input. The relative contributions to propagated uncertainties from the standard uncertainties of the input pair of measurements and various other input data (equilibrium constants etc) were explored with a new type of diagram. These error-space diagrams illustrate that further improvement beyond today’s state-of-the-art measurement uncertainties for the input pair would generally be ineffective at reducing the combined standard uncertainties because the contribution from the constants is larger. Likewise, using much more uncertain measurements of the input pair does not always substantially worsen combined standard uncertainty. The constants that contribute most to combined standard uncertainties are generally K1 and K2, as expected. Yet more of the propagated uncertainty in the computed saturation states of aragonite and calcite comes from their solubility products. Thus percent relative combined standard uncertainties for the saturation states are larger than for the carbonate ion concentration.

Herein, we determine the net calcification potential and the relative balance of net organic carbon metabolism (net community production; NCP) and net inorganic carbon metabolism (net community calcification; NCC) within 23 coral reef locations across the globe. In light of these results, we consider the suitability of using these two metrics developed from total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) measurements collected on different spatiotemporal scales to monitor coral reef biogeochemistry under anthropogenic change. All reefs in this study were net calcifying for the majority of observations as inferred from alkalinity depletion relative to offshore, although occasional observations of net dissolution occurred at most locations. However, reefs with lower net calcification potential (i.e., lower TA depletion) could shift towards net dissolution sooner than reefs with a higher potential. The percent influence of organic carbon fluxes on total changes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (i.e., NCP compared to the sum of NCP and NCC) ranged from 32% to 88% and reflected inherent biogeochemical differences between reefs. Reefs with the largest relative percentage of NCP experienced the largest variability in seawater pH for a given change in DIC, which is directly related to the reefs ability to elevate or suppress local pH relative to the open ocean.

In each mesocosm, inorganic 13C was added in order to follow carbon transfer from inorganic via bulk particulate organic carbon and phytoplankton to bacteria by means of biomarkers as well as to zooplankton and settling particles. Despite very low plankton biomasses, labelled carbon was clearly transferred through plankton communities. Incorporation rates in the various plankton compartments suggested a slow-growing community based on regenerated production in the Bay of Calvi while in the Bay of Villefranche, fast-growing species were clearly dominating community production at the start with a shift toward slow-growing species during the experiment due to nutrient limitation. Both bulk and group-specific productions rates did not respond to increasing pCO2 levels.

Yet, they are few and have low temporal resolution. At the time series station Point B in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, seawater was sampled weekly from 2007 through 2015, at 1 and 50 m, and analyzed for total dissolved inorganic carbon (CT) and total alkalinity (AT). Parameters of the carbonate system such as pH (pHT, total hydrogen ion scale) were calculated and a deconvolution analysis was performed to identify drivers of change. The rate of surface ocean acidification was −0.0028 ± 0.0003 units pHT yr−1. This rate is larger than previously identified open-ocean trends due to rapid warming that occurred over the study period (0.072 ± 0.022 °C yr−1). The total pHT change over the study period was of similar magnitude as the diel pHT variability at this site. The acidification trend can be attributed to atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) forcing (59 %, 2.08 ± 0.01 ppm CO2 yr−1) and warming (41 %). Similar trends were observed at 50 m but rates were generally slower. At 1 m depth, the increase in atmospheric CO2 accounted for approximately 40 % of the observed increase in CT (2.97 ± 0.20 µmol kg−1 yr−1). The remaining increase in CT may have been driven by the same unidentified process that caused an increase in AT (2.08 ± 0.19 µmol kg−1 yr−1). Based on the analysis of monthly trends, synchronous increases in CT and AT were fastest in the spring–summer transition. The driving process of the interannual increase in AT has a seasonal and shallow component, which may indicate riverine or groundwater influence. This study exemplifies the importance of understanding changes in coastal carbonate chemistry through the lens of biogeochemical cycling at the land–sea interface. This is the first coastal acidification time series providing multiyear data at high temporal resolution. The data confirm rapid warming in the Mediterranean Sea and demonstrate coastal acidification with a synchronous increase in total alkalinity.","tags":null,"title":"Coastal ocean acidification and increasing total alkalinity in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["EL Howes","RA Eagle","J-P Gattuso","J Bijma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"fbb611b13ad944ebb98175ee9a9c9e68","permalink":"/publication/howes-2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/howes-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Anthropogenic carbon perturbation has caused decreases in seawater pH and increases in global temperatures since the start of the 20th century. The subsequent lowering of the saturation state of CaCO3 may make the secretion of skeletons more problematic for marine calcifiers. As organisms that precipitate thin aragonite shells, thecosome pteropods have been identified as being particularly vulnerable to climate change effects. Coupled with their global distribution, this makes them ideal for use as sentinel organisms. Recent studies have highlighted shell dissolution as a potential indicator of ocean acidification; however, this metric is not applicable for monitoring pH changes in supersaturated basins. In this study, the novel approach of high resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning was used to produce quantitative 3-dimensional renderings pteropod shells to assess the potential of using this method to monitor small changes in shell biometrics that may be driven by climate change drivers. An ontogenetic analysis of the shells of Cavolinia inflexa and Styliola subula collected from the Mediterranean was used to identify suitable monitoring metrics. Modern samples were then compared to historical samples of the same species, collected during the Mediterranean leg of the Thor (1910) and Dana (1921) cruises to assess whether any empirical differences could be detected. Shell densities were calculated and scanning electron microscopy was used to compare the aragonite crystal morphology. pH for the collection years was hind-cast using temperature and salinity time series with atmospheric CO2 concentrations from ice core data. Historical samples of S. subula were thicker than S. subula shells of the same size from 2012 and C. inflexa shells collected in 1910 were significantly denser than those from 2012. These results provide a baseline for future work to develop monitoring techniques for climate change in the oceans using the novel approach of high-resolution CT scanning.","tags":null,"title":"Comparison of Mediterranean pteropod shell biometrics and ultrastructure from historical (1910 and 1921) and present day (2012) samples provides baseline for monitoring effects of global change","type":"publication"},{"authors":["EL Howes","K Kaczmarek","M Raitzsch","A Mewes","N Bijma","I Horn","S Misra","J-P Gattuso","J Bijma"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"db61674c0855c898d5a41c6094408cf7","permalink":"/publication/howes-2017-a/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/howes-2017-a/","section":"publication","summary":"In order to fully constrain paleo-carbonate systems, proxies for two out of seven parameters, plus temperature and salinity, are required. The boron isotopic composition (δ11B) of planktonic foraminifera shells is a powerful tool for reconstructing changes in past surface ocean pH. As B(OH)4− is substituted into the biogenic calcite lattice in place of CO32−, and both borate and carbonate ions are more abundant at higher pH, it was suggested early on that B ∕ Ca ratios in biogenic calcite may serve as a proxy for [CO32−]. Although several recent studies have shown that a direct connection of B ∕ Ca to carbonate system parameters may be masked by other environmental factors in the field, there is ample evidence for a mechanistic relationship between B ∕ Ca and carbonate system parameters. Here, we focus on investigating the primary relationship to develop a mechanistic understanding of boron uptake.Differentiating between the effects of pH and [CO32−] is problematic, as they co-vary closely in natural systems, so the major control on boron incorporation remains unclear. To deconvolve the effects of pH and [CO32−] and to investigate their impact on the B ∕ Ca ratio and δ11B, we conducted culture experiments with the planktonic foraminifer Orbulina universa in manipulated culture media: constant pH (8.05), but changing [CO32−] (238, 286 and 534 µmol kg−1 CO32−) and at constant [CO32−] (276 ± 19.5 µmol kg−1) and varying pH (7.7, 7.9 and 8.05). Measurements of the isotopic composition of boron and the B ∕ Ca ratio were performed simultaneously using a femtosecond laser ablation system coupled to a MC-ICP-MS (multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer). Our results show that, as expected, δ11B is controlled by pH but it is also modulated by [CO32−]. On the other hand, the B ∕ Ca ratio is driven by [HCO3−], independently of pH. This suggests that B ∕ Ca ratios in foraminiferal calcite can possibly be used as a second, independent, proxy for complete paleo-carbonate system reconstructions. This is discussed in light of recent literature demonstrating that the primary relationship between B ∕ Ca and [HCO3−] can be obscured by other environmental parameters.","tags":null,"title":"Decoupled carbonate chemistry controls on the incorporation of boron into Orbulina universa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["TE Cox","M Nash","F Gazeau","M Déniel","E Legrand","S Alliouane","P Mahacek","A Le Fur","J-P Gattuso","S Martin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"fe94fd1a151aa7f7e3347e0aa2f6b829","permalink":"/publication/cox-2017-b/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cox-2017-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Alterations in seagrass epiphytic communities are expected under future ocean acidification conditions, yet this hypothesis has been little tested in situ.

Only Foraminifera, which covered less than 3% of leaf surfaces, declined in manner consistent with ocean acidification predictions. Bulk epiphytic magnesium carbonate composition was similar between treatments and percentage of magnesium appeared to increase from summer to autumn. CCA did not exhibit any visible skeleton dissolution or mineral alteration at lowered pH and carbonate saturation state. Negative impacts from ocean acidification on P. oceanica epiphytic communities were smaller than expected. Epiphytic calcifiers were possibly protected from the pH treatment due to host plant photosynthesis inside the enclosure where water flow is slowed.

Epibiont colonization and early post settlement stages were assessed within the FOCE setup, as part of the larger community-level study, to better understand the outcome for a multispecies assemblage and the ecological processes that result in reported community shifts under altered carbonate chemistry. Two types of artificial collectors (tiles and scourers) were placed within three treatments: a pH-manipulated enclosure, an un-manipulated control enclosure, and an open plot in the ambient meadow. Tiles and scourers were collected after one to four months. Additionally, to see whether the outcome differed for communities in a later successional stage, previously settled scourer-collectors were also placed in the same three treatments. Enclosures acted to reduce settlement and migrant colonization. Scourers deployed for one to four months within the open-plot contained a community assemblage that could be distinguished from the assemblages within the enclosures. However, a comparison of enclosure assemblages on tiles showed evidence of a pH effect. There was lowered coverage of crustose coralline algae and fewer calcareous tube-forming polychaetes (Spirorbis sp. and Spirobranchus sp.) on tiles placed in the pH-manipulated enclosure compared to the un-manipulated enclosure. For assemblages in scourer collectors, shared and common taxa, in all treatments, were invertebrate polychaetes Psamathe fusca, Sphaerosyllis sp., Chrysopetalum sp., arthropods Harpacticoida, and Amphipoda, and the juvenile bivalve Lyonsia sp. Similar organism composition and abundance, as well as taxonomic richness and evenness, were found in scourers from both enclosures. Pre-settled scourers contained greater numbers of individuals and more calcified members, but the assemblage, as well as the growth rate of a juvenile bivalve Lyonsia sp., appeared unaffected by a two-month exposure to lowered pH and calcium carbonate saturation state.

These are the concentrations of 3 nutrients [nitrate (NO3−), phosphate (PO43−) and silicate (Si(OH)4)] and 4 carbonate system parameters [total alkalinity (AT), dissolved inorganic carbon (CT), pH (pHT) and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2)], which are estimated from concurrent in situ measurements of temperature, salinity, hydrostatic pressure and oxygen (O2) together with sampling latitude, longitude and date. Seven neural-networks were developed using the GLODAPv2 database, which is largely representative of the diversity of open-ocean conditions, hence making CANYON potentially applicable to most oceanic environments. For each variable, CANYON was trained using 80 % randomly chosen data from the whole database (after eight 10° x 10° zones removed providing an \"independent data-set\" for additional validation), the remaining 20 % data were used for the neural-network test of validation. Overall, CANYON retrieved the variables with high accuracies (RMSE): 0.93 mol kg-1 (NO3−), 0.07 mol kg-1 (PO43-), 3.0 mol kg-1 (Si(OH)4), 0.019 (pHT), 7 mol kg-1 (AT), 10 mol kg-1 (CT) and 28 atm (pCO2). This was confirmed for the 8 independent zones not included in the training process. CANYON was also applied to the Hawaiian Time Series site to produce a 22-years long simulated time series for the above 7 variables. Comparison of modeled and measured data was also very satisfactory (RMSE in the order of magnitude of RMSE from validation test). CANYON is thus a promising method to derive distributions of key biogeochemical variables. It could be used for a variety of global and regional applications ranging from data quality control to the production of datasets of variables required for initialization and validation of biogeochemical models but difficult to obtain. In particular, combining the increased coverage of the global Biogeochemical-Argo program, where O2 is one of the core variables now very accurately measured, with the CANYON approach offers the fascinating perspective of obtaining large-scale estimates of key biogeochemical variables with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions.","tags":null,"title":"Estimates of water-column nutrients concentration and carbonate system parameters in the global ocean: A novel approach based on neural networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n  Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

Changes in primary production in these areas could have important impacts on future global carbon cycling. To assess the response of primary production and respiration of plankton communities to increasing partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) levels in Low Nutrient Low Chorophyll areas, two mesocosm experiments were conducted in the Bay of Calvi (Corsica, France) and in the Bay of Villefranche (France) in June-July 2012 and February-March 2013 under different trophic state, temperature and irradiance conditions. Nine mesocosms of 50 m3 were deployed for 20 and 12 days, respectively, and were subjected to seven pCO2 levels (3 control and 6 elevated levels). The metabolism of the community was studied using several methods based on in situ incubations (oxygen light-dark, 18O and 14C uptake). Increasing pCO2 had no significant effect on gross primary production, net community production, particulate and dissolved carbon production, as well as on community respiration. These two mesocosm experiments, the first performed under maintained low nutrient and low chlorophyll, suggest that in large areas of the ocean, increasing pCO2 levels may not lead to a significant change in plankton metabolic rates and sea surface biological carbon fixation.","tags":null,"title":"No detectable effect of ocean acidification on plankton metabolism in the NW oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea: results from two mesocosm studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L Maugendre","C Guieu","J-P Gattuso","F Gazeau"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"9f17660e660d71989e79ebd590c36dc2","permalink":"/publication/maugendre-2017-b/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/maugendre-2017-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Planet Earth has entered a new geological era, the Anthropocene, in which geologically significant conditions and processes are profoundly altered by human activities (Waters et al., 2016).

To facilitate data comparison, a data compilation hosted at the data publisher PANGAEA was initiated in 2008 and is updated on a regular basis (doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.149999). By January 2015, a total of 581 data sets (over 4 000 000 data points) from 539 papers had been archived. Here we present the developments of this data compilation 5 years since its first description by Nisumaa et al. (2010). Most of the study sites from which data have been archived are in the Northern Hemisphere and the number of archived data from studies from the Southern Hemisphere and polar oceans is still relatively low. Data from 60 studies that investigated the response of a mix of organisms or natural communities were all added after 2010, indicating a welcome shift from the study of individual organisms to communities and ecosystems. The initial imbalance of considerably more data archived on calcification and primary production than on other processes has improved. There is also a clear tendency towards more data archived from multifactorial studies after 2010. For easier and more effective access to ocean acidification data, the ocean acidification community is strongly encouraged to contribute to the data archiving effort, and help develop standard vocabularies describing the variables and define best practices for archiving ocean acidification data.","tags":null,"title":"Data compilation on the biological response to ocean acidification: an update","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C Maier","P Popp","N Sollfrank","M.

The aragonite saturation threshold (Ωa) for calcification, respiration and organic matter fluxes were investigated experimentally in the Mediterranean Madrepora oculata. Over 10 weeks, colonies were maintained under two feeding regimes (uptake of 36.75 and 7.46 µmol C polyp−1 week−1) and exposed in 2 week intervals to a consecutively changing air–CO2 mix (pCO2) of 400, 1600, 800, 2000 and 400 ppm. There was a significant effect of feeding on calcification at initial ambient pCO2, while with consecutive pCO2 treatments, feeding had no effect on calcification. Respiration was not significantly affected by feeding or pCO2 levels. Coral skeletons started to dissolve at an average Ωa threshold of 0.92, but recovered and started to calcify again at Ωa≥1. The surplus energy required to counteract dissolution at elevated pCO2 (≥1600 µatm) was twice that at ambient pCO2. Yet, feeding had no mitigating effect at increasing pCO2 levels. This could be due to the fact that the energy required for calcification is a small fraction (1–3%) of the total metabolic energy demand and corals even under low food conditions might therefore still be able to allocate this small portion of energy to calcification. The response and resistance to ocean acidification are consequently not controlled by feeding in this species, but more likely by chemical reactions at the site of calcification and exchange processes between the calicoblastic layer and ambient seawater.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of elevated pCO|2| and feeding on net calcification and energy budget of the Mediterranean cold-water coral Madrepora oculata","type":"publication"},{"authors":["TE Cox","F Gazeau","S Alliouane","IE Hendriks","P Mahacek","A Le Fur","J-P Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451602800,"objectID":"0604aa46777e19ed0d0889eca69643f2","permalink":"/publication/cox-2016-a/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cox-2016-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Seagrass is expected to benefit from increased carbon availability under future ocean acidification. This hypothesis has been little tested by in situ manipulation. To test for ocean acidification effects on seagrass meadows under controlled CO2/pH conditions, we used a Free Ocean Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FOCE) system which allows for the manipulation of pH as continuous offset from ambient. It was deployed in a Posidonia oceanica meadow at 11 m depth in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea. It consisted of two benthic enclosures, an experimental and a control unit both 1.7 m3, and an additional reference plot in the ambient environment (2 m2) to account for structural artifacts. The meadow was monitored from April to November 2014. The pH of the experimental enclosure was lowered by 0.26 pH units for the second half of the 8-month study. The greatest magnitude of change in P. oceanica leaf biometrics, photosynthesis, and leaf growth accompanied seasonal changes recorded in the environment and values were similar between the two enclosures. Leaf thickness may change in response to lower pH but this requires further testing. Results are congruent with other short-term and natural studies that have investigated the response of P. oceanica over a wide range of pH. They suggest any benefit from ocean acidification, over the next century (at a pH of  ∼ 7.7 on the total scale), on Posidonia physiology and growth may be minimal and difficult to detect without increased replication or longer experimental duration. The limited stimulation, which did not surpass any enclosure or seasonal effect, casts doubts on speculations that elevated CO2 would confer resistance to thermal stress and increase the buffering capacity of meadows.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of in situ CO|2| enrichment on structural characteristics, photosynthesis, and growth of the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L-Q Jiang","KM Arzayus","J-P Gattuso","HE Garcia","C Chandler","A Kozyr","Y Yang","R Thomas","B Beck","T Spears"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451602800,"objectID":"1ed35c5afa24cd6fbcf172fc70f75d4e","permalink":"/publication/jiang-2016/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/jiang-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The number of ocean acidification (OA) studies has increased significantly over the last decade.

Many of these gaps focus on calcification at the levels of cells, organisms, populations, communities, and ecosystem, and their closure will be made difficult by the complexity of the interdependent processes by which coral reefs respond to ocean acidification, with effects scaling from cells to ecosystems and from microns to kilometers.

With slow progress towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, climate engineering, including Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) techniques such as ocean fertilisation or Solar Radiation Management (SRM) by stratospheric sulphate aerosol injections, is receiving increasing attention for its potential in mitigating climate change. Proposed interventions are intended to significantly alter the climate system (including its terrestrial, marine and atmospheric subsystems): yet the potential effects on biodiversity and ecosystems have received little attention. A process of ‘impact scanning’ was used to collate a list of potential ecological effects of climate engineering from the literature. We then used a modified Delphi technique with a group of experienced researchers to rank the effects of different climate engineering techniques on biodiversity and ecosystems, based upon an assessment of the relative importance of their consequences and the amount of existing scientific understanding about them. These assessments were used to identify priority topics for further research, and to formulate specific key research questions for those environmental changes considered to be of highest priority. This first detailed evaluation is a critical starting point for further ecological research to increase understanding of the biodiversity and ecosystem consequences of climate engineering techniques. It also provides a valuable indication for policy makers of the key ecological issues that must be considered in scoping climate engineering options and decision making.","tags":null,"title":"Key impacts of climate engineering on biodiversity and ecosystems, with priorities for future research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["MC Nash","S Martin","J-P Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451602800,"objectID":"818e93ca5e11dcfe91ba0c81c0fc9809","permalink":"/publication/nash-2016-a/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/nash-2016-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Red calcareous coralline algae are thought to be among the organisms most vulnerable to ocean acidification due to the high solubility of their magnesium calcite skeleton. Although skeletal mineralogy is proposed to change as CO2 and temperature continue to rise, there is currently very little information available on the response of coralline algal carbonate mineralogy to near-future changes in pCO2 and temperature. Here we present results from a 1-year controlled laboratory experiment to test mineralogical responses to pCO2 and temperature in the Mediterranean crustose coralline alga (CCA) Lithophyllum cabiochae. Our results show that Mg incorporation is mainly constrained by temperature (+1 mol % MgCO3 for an increase of 3 °C), and there was no response to pCO2. This suggests that L. cabiochae thalli have the ability to buffer their calcifying medium against ocean acidification, thereby enabling them to continue to deposit magnesium calcite with a significant mol % MgCO3 under elevated pCO2. Analyses of CCA dissolution chips showed a decrease in Mg content after 1 year for all treatments, but this was affected neither by pCO2 nor by temperature. Our findings suggest that biological processes exert a strong control on calcification on magnesium calcite and that CCA may be more resilient under rising CO2 than previously thought. However, previously demonstrated increased skeletal dissolution with ocean acidification will still have major consequences for the stability and maintenance of Mediterranean coralligenous habitats.","tags":null,"title":"Mineralogical response of the Mediterranean crustose coralline alga Lithophyllum cabiochae to near-future ocean acidification and warming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Moya","EL Howes","T Lacoue-Labarthe","S Forêt","B Hanna","M Medina","PL Munday","J-S Ong","J-L Teyssié","G Torda","S-A Watson","DJ Miller","J Bijma","J-P Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451602800,"objectID":"cf839c50401fac8838a2f89aa0436523","permalink":"/publication/moya-2016/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/moya-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Shelled pteropods play key roles in the global carbon cycle and food webs of various ecosystems. Their thin external shell is sensitive to small changes in pH and shell dissolution has already been observed in areas where aragonite saturation state is ~ 1. A decline in pteropod abundance has the potential to disrupt trophic networks and directly impact commercial fisheries. Therefore it is crucial to understand how pteropods will be affected by global environmental change, particularly ocean acidification. In the present study, physiological and molecular approaches were used to investigate the response of the Mediterranean pteropod, Heliconoides inflatus, to pH values projected for 2100 under a moderate emissions trajectory (RCP6.0). Pteropods were subjected to pHT 7.9 for 3 d, and gene expression levels, calcification and respiration rates were measured relative to pHT 8.1 controls. Gross calcification decreased markedly under low pH conditions, while genes potentially involved in calcification were up-regulated, reflecting the inability of pteropods to maintain calcification rates. Gene expression data imply that under low pH conditions both metabolic processes and protein synthesis may be compromised, while genes involved in acid-base regulation were up- regulated. A large number of genes related to nervous system structure and function were also up-regulated in the low pH treatment, including a GABAA receptor subunit. This observation is particularly interesting because GABAA receptor disturbances, leading to altered behaviour, have been documented in several other marine animals after exposure to elevated CO2. The up-regulation of many genes involved in nervous system function suggests that exposure to low pH could have major effects on pteropod behaviour. This study illustrates the power of combining physiological and molecular approaches. It also reveals the importance of behavioural analyses in studies aimed at understanding the impacts of low pH on marine animals.","tags":null,"title":"Near-future pH conditions severely impact calcification, metabolism and the nervous system in the pteropod Heliconoides inflatus","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

The IPCC AR5 highlighted several areas related to both the physical and biological processes that required further research. As a rapidly developing field, there have been many pertinent studies published since the cut off dates for the AR5, which have increased our understanding of the processes at work. This study undertook an extensive review of recently published literature to update the findings of the AR5 and provide a synthesized review on the main issues facing future oceans. The level of detail provided in the AR5 and subsequent work provided a basis for constructing projections of the state of ocean ecosystems in 2100 under two the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP4.5 and 8.5.

However, total alkalinity is also influenced by other processes such as nutrient consumption and release, and may also require corrections. The calcium anomaly technique has been little used because calcium is notoriously difficult to measure precisely and several species precipitate calcite with varying contents of magnesium. In this study, calcification rates of benthic calcifiers—a crustose coralline alga, a coral, a sea urchin, and a mussel—were estimated with these 2 approaches. Rates derived using the 2 methods were well correlated for all species and did not significantly differ from each other for corals incubated in the light and dark, and for coralline algae when incubated in the dark. Coralline algae appear to produce magnesian calcite in the light. Sea urchins and mussels released relatively large amounts of ammonia, and a correction of the alkalinity anomaly method was necessary. For urchins, calcification rates based on total alkalinity were higher than rates based on calcium as these organisms incorporate magnesium. For mussels, the corrected alkalinity anomaly technique provided values close to those based on calcium anomaly at low incubation densities, but values were significantly lower at high calcification and excretion rates, suggesting that ammonium concentrations were underestimated or another process affected total alkalinity. The results demonstrate that the alkalinity and calcium anomaly techniques are not robustly applicable to all calcifiers without careful consideration of organism physiology and mineralogy.","tags":null,"title":"Comparison of the alkalinity and calcium anomaly techniques to estimate rates of net calcification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J­-P Gattuso","A Magnan","R Billé","WWL Cheung","EL Howes","F Joos","D Allemand","L Bopp","S Cooley","CM Eakin","O Hoegh-Guldberg","RP Kelly","H‐O Pörtner","AD Rogers","JM Baxter","D Laffoley","D Osborn","A Rankovic","J Rochette","UR Sumaila","S Treyer","C Turley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"4e5dc0ed9b26d5945cc058a820225f37","permalink":"/publication/gattuso-2015-j/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gattuso-2015-j/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUNDAlthough the ocean moderates anthropogenic climate change, this has great impacts on its fundamental physics and chemistry, with important consequences for ecosystems and people. Yet, despite the ocean’s critical role in regulating climate—and providing food security and livelihoods for millions of people—international climate negotiations have only minimally considered impacts on the ocean. Here, we evaluate changes to the ocean and its ecosystems, as well as to the goods and services they provide, under two contrasting CO2 scenarios: the current high-emissions trajectory (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, RCP8.5) and a stringent emissions scenario (RCP2.6) consistent with the Copenhagen Accord of keeping mean global temperature increase below 2°C in the 21st century. To do this, we draw on the consensus science in the latest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and papers published since the assessment.ADVANCESWarming and acidification of surface ocean waters will increase proportionately with cumulative CO2 emissions (see figure). Warm-water corals have already been affected, as have mid-latitude seagrass, high-latitude pteropods and krill, mid-latitude bivalves, and fin fishes. Even under the stringent emissions scenario (RCP2.6), warm-water corals and mid-latitude bivalves will be at high risk by 2100. Under our current rate of emissions, most marine organisms evaluated will have very high risk of impacts by 2100 and many by 2050. These results—derived from experiments, field observations, and modeling—are consistent with evidence from high-CO2 periods in the paleorecord.Impacts to the ocean’s ecosystem services follow a parallel trajectory. Services such as coastal protection and capture fisheries are already affected by ocean warming and acidification. The risks of impacts to these services increase with continued emissions: They are predicted to remain moderate for the next 85 years for most services under stringent emission reductions, but the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5) would put all ecosystem services we considered at high or very high risk over the same time frame. These impacts will be cumulative or synergistic with other human impacts, such as overexploitation of living resources, habitat destruction, and pollution. Fin fisheries at low latitudes, which are a key source of protein and income for millions of people, will be at high risk.OUTLOOKFour key messages emerge. First, the ocean strongly influences the climate system and provides important services to humans. Second, impacts on key marine and coastal organisms, ecosystems, and services are already detectable, and several will face high risk of impacts well before 2100, even under the low-emissions scenario (RCP2.6). These impacts will occur across all latitudes, making this a global concern beyond the north/south divide. Third, immediate and substantial reduction of CO2 emissions is required to prevent the massive and mostly irreversible impacts on ocean ecosystems and their services that are projected with emissions greater than those in RCP2.6. Limiting emissions to this level is necessary to meet stated objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; a substantially different ocean would result from any less-stringent emissions scenario. Fourth, as atmospheric CO2 increases, protection, adaptation, and repair options for the ocean become fewer and less effective.The ocean provides compelling arguments for rapid reductions in CO2 emissions and eventually atmospheric CO2 drawdown. Hence, any new global climate agreement that does not minimize the impacts on the ocean will be inadequate.

However, intraspecific genetic diversity was extensively remodeled between Indian and Atlantic plankton populations. Direct in situ sampling of a young Agulhas ring indicated that strong vertical mixing within the rings drove complex nitrogen cycling, shaping community metabolism and biogeochemical signatures as plankton transited westwards.

The assemblage was sampled in March 2012 and exposed to the following four treatments for 12 days: control (∼360 μatm, 14°C), elevated pCO2 (∼610 μatm, 14°C), elevated temperature (∼410 μatm, 17°C), and elevated pCO2 and temperature (∼690 μatm, 17°C). Nutrients were already depleted at the beginning of the experiment and the concentrations of chlorophyll a (chl a), heterotrophic prokaryotes and viruses decreased, under all treatments, throughout the experiment. There were no statistically significant effects of ocean warming and acidification, whether in isolation or combined, on the concentrations of nutrients, particulate organic matter, chl a and most of the photosynthetic pigments. Furthermore, 13C labelling showed that the carbon transfer rates from 13C-sodium bicarbonate into particulate organic carbon were not affected by seawater warming nor acidification. Rates of gross primary production followed the general decreasing trend of chl a concentrations and were significantly higher under elevated temperature, an effect exacerbated when combined to elevated pCO2 level. In contrast to the other algal groups, the picophytoplankton population (cyanobacteria, mostly Synechococcus) increased throughout the experiment and was more abundant in the warmer treatment though to a lesser extent when combined to high pCO2 level. These results suggest that under nutrient-depleted conditions in the Mediterranean Sea, ocean acidification has a very limited impact on the plankton community and that small species will benefit from warming with a potential decrease of the export and energy transfer to higher trophic levels.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of ocean warming and acidification on a plankton community in the NW Mediterranean Sea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["TE Cox","S Schenone","J Delille","V Díaz-Castañeda","S Alliouane","J-P Gattuso","F Gazeau"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"0f48abebc1a38acb68df17fd6b1a9eab","permalink":"/publication/cox-2015-c/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cox-2015-c/","section":"publication","summary":"Biological interactions can alter predictions that are based on single-species physiological response. It is known that leaf segments of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica will increase photosynthesis with lowered pH, but it is not clear whether the outcome will be altered when the whole plant and its epiphyte community, with different respiratory and photosynthetic demands, are included. In addition, the effects on the Posidonia epiphyte community have rarely been tested under controlled conditions, at near-future pH levels.In order to better evaluate the effects of pH levels as projected for the upcoming decades on seagrass meadows, shoots of P. oceanica with their associated epiphytes were exposed in the laboratory to three pH levels (ambient: 8.1, 7.7 and 7.3, on the total scale) for 4 weeks. Net productivity, respiration, net calcification and leaf fluorescence were measured on several occasions. At the end of the study, epiphyte community abundance and composition, calcareous mass and crustose coralline algae growth were determined. Finally, photosynthesis vs. irradiance curves (PE) was produced from segments of secondary leaves cleaned of epiphytes and pigments extracted.Posidonia leaf fluorescence and chlorophyll concentrations did not differ between pH treatments. Net productivity of entire shoots and epiphyte-free secondary leaves increased significantly at the lowest pH level yet limited or no stimulation in productivity was observed at the intermediate pH treatment. Under both pH treatments, significant decreases in epiphytic cover were observed, mostly due to the reduction of crustose coralline algae. The loss of the dominant epiphyte producer yet similar photosynthetic response for epiphyte-free secondary leaves and shoots suggests a minimal contribution of epiphytes to shoot productivity under experimental conditions.Synthesis. Observed responses indicate that under future ocean acidification conditions foreseen in the next century an increase in Posidonia productivity is not likely despite the partial loss of epiphytic coralline algae which are competitors for light. A decline in epiphytic cover could, however, reduce the feeding capacity of the meadow for invertebrates. In situ long-term experiments that consider both acidification and warming scenarios are needed to improve ecosystem-level predictions.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of ocean acidification on Posidonia oceanica epiphytic community and shoot productivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["U Riebesell","J-P Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"45672d8b31f5e19aa61a3f4d85f3482e","permalink":"/publication/riebesell-2015-a/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/riebesell-2015-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Reflection on the rapidly growing field of ocean acidification research highlights priorities for future research on the changing ocean.","tags":null,"title":"Lessons learned from ocean acidification research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Réveillac","T Lacoue-Labarthe","F Oberhänsli","J-L Teyssié","R Jeffree","J-P Gattuso","S Martin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"63c8b9330e10f6e1c7fcd21ec8711f51","permalink":"/publication/reveillac-2015-a/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/reveillac-2015-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The effects of elevated CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) on otolith calcification and on the coupling between somatic and otolith growth were investigated in juvenile gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata.

The only previous whole transcriptome study (Moya et al. 2012) documented extensive disruption of gene expression, particularly of genes encoding skeletal organic matrix proteins, in juvenile corals (A. millepora) after short-term (3 d) exposure to elevated pCO2. In the present study, whole transcriptome analysis was used to compare the effects of such \"acute\" (3 d) exposure to elevated pCO2 with a longer (\"prolonged\"; 9 d) period of exposure beginning immediately post-fertilisation. Far fewer genes were differentially expressed under the 9 d treatment and, although the transcriptome data implied wholesale disruption of metabolism and calcification genes in the acute treatment experiment, expression of most genes was at control levels after prolonged treatment. There was little overlap between the genes responding to the acute and prolonged treatments, but HSPs and HSFs were over-represented amongst the genes responding to both treatments. Amongst these was an HSP70 gene previously shown to be involved in acclimation to thermal stress in a field population of another acroporid coral. The most obvious feature of the molecular response in the 9 d treatment experiment was the up-regulation of five distinct Bcl-2 family members, the majority predicted to be anti-apoptotic. This suggests that an important component of the longer-term response to elevated CO2 is suppression of apoptosis. It therefore appears that juvenile A. millepora have the capacity to rapidly acclimate to elevated pCO2, a process mediated by up-regulation of specific HSPs and a suite of Bcl-2 family members.","tags":null,"title":"Rapid acclimation of juvenile corals to CO|2|-mediated acidification by up-regulation of HSP and Bcl-2 genes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C Pretet","E Samankassou","T Felis","S Reynaud","F Böhm","A Eisenhauer","C Ferrier-Pagès","J-P Gattuso","G Camoin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"9ffa9e3284a4e57c79f523add8ec55c5","permalink":"/publication/pretet-2014-a/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pretet-2014-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The effect of salinity on the elemental and isotopic skeletal composition of modern zooxanthellate scleractinian corals (Acropora sp., Montipora verrucosa and Stylophora pistillata) was investigated in order to evaluated potential salinity proxies.

This will be most pronounced in the Arctic Ocean. If atmospheric pCO2 levels continue to rise at current rates, about 10 % of the Arctic surface waters will be corrosive for aragonite by 2018 (Steinacher et al., 2009). By 2050 one-half of the Arctic Ocean will be sub-saturated with respect to aragonite. By the end of this century corrosive conditions are projected to have spread over the entire Arctic Ocean (Steinacher et al., 2009). In view of these rapid changes in seawater chemistry, marine organisms and ecosystems in the Arctic are considered particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification.

The weekly data collected at this site, designated as \"Point B\" (EGS 84, 43° 41.10’N - 7° 18.94’E), since 1957 represent a long-term time series of hydrological conditions in a coastal environment.

Previous studies focused on the δ44/40Ca record in different marine organisms to reconstruct seawater composition or temperature, but only few studies looked at corals. This study presents measurements performed on modern corals from natural environments (from the Maldives for modern and from Tahiti for fossil corals) as well as from laboratory cultures (Centre scientifique de Monaco). Measurements on Porites sp., Acropora sp., Montipora verrucosa and Stylophora pistillata allow constraining inter-generic variability.Our results show that the fractionation of δ44/40Ca ranges from 0.62 to 0.99‰, independently of the genus or the environmental conditions. No significant relationship between the rate of calcification and δ44/40Ca was found. The weak temperature dependence reported in earlier studies is possibly not the only parameter that is responsible for the fractionation. Indeed, sub-seasonal temperature variations reconstructed by δ18O and Sr/Ca ratio using a multi-proxy approach, are not mirrored in the coral’s δ44/40Ca variations. The inter- and intra-generic variability among the studied samples is weak except for S. pistillata, which shows calcium isotopic values increasing with salinity. The variability between samples cultured at a salinity of 40 is higher than those cultured at a salinity of 36 for this species. The present study reveals a strong biological control of the skeletal isotopic composition by the polyp and a weak influence of environmental factors, specifically temperature and salinity (except for S. pistillata), on the calcium isotopic fractionation. Vital effects have to be investigated in situ to better constrain their influence on the calcium isotopic signal.

Although bacteria play a major role in carbon cycling, little is known about the impact of rising pCO2 on bacterial carbon metabolism, especially for natural bacterial communities. In this study, we investigated the effect of rising pCO2 on bacterial production (BP), bacterial respiration (BR) and bacterial carbon metabolism during a mesocosm experiment performed in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard) in 2010. Nine mesocosms with pCO2 levels ranging from ca. 180 to 1400 μatm were deployed in the fjord and monitored for 30 days. Generally BP gradually decreased in all mesocosms in an initial phase, showed a large (3.6-fold average) but temporary increase on day 10, and increased slightly after inorganic nutrient addition. Over the wide range of pCO2 investigated, the patterns in BP and growth rate of bulk and free-living communities were generally similar over time. However, BP of the bulk community significantly decreased with increasing pCO2 after nutrient addition (day 14). In addition, increasing pCO2 enhanced the leucine to thymidine (Leu : TdR) ratio at the end of experiment, suggesting that pCO2 may alter the growth balance of bacteria. Stepwise multiple regression analysis suggests that multiple factors, including pCO2, explained the changes of BP, growth rate and Leu : TdR ratio at the end of the experiment. In contrast to BP, no clear trend and effect of changes of pCO2 was observed for BR, bacterial carbon demand and bacterial growth efficiency. Overall, the results suggest that changes in pCO2 potentially influence bacterial production, growth rate and growth balance rather than the conversion of dissolved organic matter into CO2.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of CO|2| enrichment on bacterial metabolism in an Arctic fjord","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

Surface water, which was characterized by low concentrations of dissolved inorganic nutrients and chlorophyll, was enclosed in 9 mesocosms and subjected to 8 pCO2 levels (2 replicated controls and 7 enhanced pCO2 treatments) for one month. Nutrients were added to all mesocosms on day 13 of the experiment, and thereafter increase of chlorophyll (index of phytoplankton biomass) was provoked in all mesocosms. No clear trend in response to increasing pCO2 was found in the daily values of NCP, CR, and GCP. For further analysis, these parameters were cumulated for the following three periods: phase 1: end of CO2 manipulation until nutrient addition (t4 to t13); phase 2: nutrient addition until the second chlorophyll minimum (t14 to t21); phase 3: the second chlorophyll minimum until the end of this study (t22 to t28). Significant response was detected as a decrease of NCP with increasing pCO2 during phase 3. CR was relatively stable throughout the experiment in all mesocosms. As a result, the cumulative GCP significantly decreased with increasing pCO2 during phase 3. After the nutrient addition, the ratios of cumulative NCP to cumulative consumption of NO3 and PO4 showed significant decrease during phase 3 with increasing pCO2. The results suggest that elevated pCO2 influenced cumulative NCP and stoichiometric C and nutrient coupling of the plankton community in a high latitude fjord only for a limited period. However provided that there were some differences or weak correlations between NCP data based on different methods in the same experiment, this conclusion should be taken with caution.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of increased pCO|2| on the planktonic metabolic balance during a mesocosm experiment in an Arctic fjord","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C Maier","A Schubert","MM Berzunza Sànchez","MG Weinbauer","P Watremez","J-P Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356994800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356994800,"objectID":"35ccfed0c680e4099f055c6c022e6139","permalink":"/publication/maier-2013-c/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/maier-2013-c/","section":"publication","summary":"Ocean acidification caused by anthropogenic uptake of CO2 is perceived to be a major threat to calcifying organisms.

Calcification rates of two Mediterranean cold- water coral species, L. pertusa and M. oculata, were studied under variable CO2 concentrations that ranged between 380 μatm for present-day conditions and 930 μatm which is slightly above the pCO2 value projected for the end of the century.

Besides studying the direct, short-term response the study aimed at elucidating on the potential for acclimation of cold-water corals to ocean acidification. Net calcification of both species was unaffected by the levels of pCO2 investigated and revealed no short-term shock and, therefore, no long-term acclimation to changes in the carbonate chemistry. The use of proper control conditions revealed that increasing calcification rates over time were not caused by acclimation to higher pCO2 but that they had to be attributed to other factors either related to general aquarium maintenance or related to coral biology and functioning.","tags":null,"title":"End of the century pCO|2| levels do not impact net calcification in Mediterranean cold-water corals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kristy Kroeker","Rebecca Kordas","Ryan Crim","Iris Hendriks","Laura Ramajo","Gerald Singh","Carlos Duarte","Jean-Pierre Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356994800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356994800,"objectID":"2312571ed607bd76d3e56267998401aa","permalink":"/publication/kroeker-2013-c/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kroeker-2013-c/","section":"publication","summary":"Ocean acidification represents a threat to marine species and ecosystems worldwide.

Of growing concern are the impacts that this will have on marine and estuarine organisms and ecosystems. Marine shelled molluscs, that colonized a large latitudinal gradient and can be found from intertidal to deep-sea habitats, are economically and ecologically important species providing essential ecosystem services including habitat structure for benthic organisms, water purification and a food source for other organisms. The effects of ocean acidification on the growth and shell production by juvenile and adult molluscs are variable among species and even within the same species, precluding the drawing of a general picture. This is, however, not the case for pteropods, with all species tested so far, being negatively impacted by ocean acidification. The blood of shelled mollusks may exhibit lower pH with consequences for several physiological processes (e.g. respiration, excretion.) and, in some cases, increased mortality in the long term. While fertilization may remain unaffected by elevated pCO2, embryonic and larval development will be highly sensitive with important reductions in size and decreased survival of larvae, increases in the number of abnormal larvae and an increase in the developmental time. There are big gaps in the current understanding of the biological consequences of an acidifying ocean on shelled molluscs. For instance, the natural variability of pH and the interactions of changes in the carbonate chemistry with changes in other environmental stressors such as increased temperature and changing salinity, the effects of species interactions, as well as the capacity of the organisms to acclimate and/or adapt to changing environmental conditions are poorly described.","tags":null,"title":"Impacts of ocean acidification on marine shelled molluscs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N Dorey","F Melzner","S Martin","F Oberhänsli","J-L Teyssié","P Bustamante","J-P Gattuso","T Lacoue-Labarthe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356994800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356994800,"objectID":"d8e748cc51beaa773f9ed2bb35b34650","permalink":"/publication/dorey-2013-c/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dorey-2013-c/","section":"publication","summary":"Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions simultaneously cause ocean warming andacidification, impacting marine calcifying species.

Also, the high detected community respiration rates confirm that the the twilight zone plays a critical role as hub between surface and deep water. Correlation analyses indicate that dissolved organic carbon and transparent organic particles were controlling factors of bacterial community composition, whereas the archaeal community was likely controlled by other mechanisms.

In particular, we investigate the assumption that fighting acidification is mainly, but not only, about reducing CO2 emissions, and explore the leeway that this emerging problem may open in old environmental issues. We review nine types of management responses, initially grouped under four categories: preventing ocean acidification; strengthening ecosystem resilience; adapting human activities; and repairing damages. Connecting and comparing options leads to classifying them, in a qualitative way, according to their potential and feasibility. While reducing CO2 emissions is confirmed as the key action that must be taken against acidification, some of the other options appear to have the potential to buy time, e.g. by relieving the pressure of other stressors, and help marine life face unavoidable acidification. Although the existing legal basis to take action shows few gaps, policy challenges are significant: tackling them will mean succeeding in various areas of environmental management where we failed to a large extent so far.","tags":null,"title":"Taking action against ocean acidification: a review of management and policy options","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C Maier","P Watremez","M Taviani","MG Weinbauer","J-P Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325372400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325372400,"objectID":"d4a3403b11dd919f39c82da86a8fa709","permalink":"/publication/maier-2012/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/maier-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Global environmental changes, including ocean acidification, have been identified as a major threat to scleractinian corals.

Cold-water corals (CWCs) are thought to be strongly affected by changes in ocean acidification owing to their distribution in deep and/or cold waters, which naturally exhibit a CaCO3 saturation state lower than in shallow/warm waters.

Early life history stages of Acropora spp. provide an opportunity to study the effects of elevated CO2 on coral calcification without the complication of symbiont metabolism. Therefore, we used the Illumina RNAseq approach to study the effects of acute exposure to elevated CO2 on gene expression in primary polyps of Acropora millepora, using as reference a novel comprehensive transcriptome assembly developed for this study. Gene ontology analysis of this whole transcriptome data set indicated that CO2-driven acidification strongly suppressed metabolism but enhanced extracellular organic matrix synthesis, whereas targeted analyses revealed complex effects on genes implicated in calcification. Unexpectedly, expression of most ion transport proteins was unaffected, while many membrane-associated or secreted carbonic anhydrases were expressed at lower levels. The most dramatic effect of CO2-driven acidification, however, was on genes encoding candidate and known components of the skeletal organic matrix that controls CaCO3 deposition. The skeletal organic matrix effects included elevated expression of adult-type galaxins and some secreted acidic proteins, but down-regulation of other galaxins, secreted acidic proteins, SCRiPs and other coral-specific genes, suggesting specialized roles for the members of these protein families and complex impacts of OA on mineral deposition.

This ratio, which has been termed w, is about 0.6 in surface seawater at 25°C and at equilibrium with contemporary atmospheric CO2 and increases towards 1.0 as seawater cools and pCO2 increases. These conclusions are based on field observations, laboratory experiments, and equilibrium calculations for the seawater carbonate system. Yet global geochemical modeling indicates that small departures of W from 1.0 would cause dramatic, rapid, and unrealistic change in atmospheric CO2. W can be meaningfully calculated for a water sample whether or not it is in equilibrium with the atmosphere. The analysis presented here demonstrates that the atmospheric CO2 balance can be maintained constant with respect to seawater CaCO3 reactions if one considers the difference between CaCO3 precipitation and burial and differing values for w (both 1.0) in regions of pre- cipitation and dissolution within the ocean.","tags":null,"title":"Balancing the oceanic calcium carbonate cycle: consequences of variable water column Ψ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R Rodolfo-Metalpa","F Houlbrèque","E Tambutté","F Boisson","C Baggini","FP Patti","R Jeffree","M Fine","A Foggo","J-P Gattuso","JM Hall-Spencer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293836400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293836400,"objectID":"9784877e154261c51f384ef54bc9a359","permalink":"/publication/rodolfo-metalpa-2011/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/rodolfo-metalpa-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are expected to decrease surface ocean pH by 0.3–0.5 units by 2100, lowering the carbonate ion concentration of surface waters. This rapid acidification is predicted to dramatically decrease calcification in many marine organisms. Reduced skeletal growth under increased CO2 levels has already been shown for corals, molluscs and many other marine organisms. The impact of acidification on the ability of individual species to calcify has remained elusive, however, as measuring net calcification fails to disentangle the relative contributions of gross calcification and dissolution rates on growth. Here, we show that corals and molluscs transplanted along gradients of carbonate saturation state at Mediterranean CO2 vents are able to calcify and grow at even faster than normal rates when exposed to the high CO2 levels projected for the next 300 years. Calcifiers remain at risk, however, owing to the dissolution of exposed shells and skeletons that occurs as pH levels fall. Our results show that tissues and external organic layers play a major role in protecting shells and skeletons from corrosive sea water, limiting dissolution and allowing organisms to calcify.

Projections of ocean acidification, however, are based on air-sea fluxes in the open ocean, and not for shallow-water systems such as coral reefs. Like the open ocean, reef waters are subject to the chemical forcing of increasing atmospheric pCO2. However, for reefs with long water residence times, we illustrate that benthic carbon fluxes can drive spatial variation in pH, pCO2 and aragonite saturation state (Ωa) that can mask the effects of ocean acidification in some downstream habitats. We use a carbon flux model for photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and dissolution coupled with Lagrangian transport to examine how key groups of calcifiers (zooxanthellate corals) and primary producers (macroalgae) on coral reefs contribute to changes in the seawater carbonate system as a function of water residence time. Analyses based on flume data showed that the carbon fluxes of corals and macroalgae drive Ωain opposing directions. Areas dominated by corals elevate pCO2 and reduce Ωa, thereby compounding ocean acidification effects in downstream habitats, whereas algal beds draw CO2 down and elevate Ωa, potentially offsetting ocean acidification impacts at the local scale. Simulations for two CO2 scenarios (600 and 900 ppm CO2) suggested that a potential shift from coral to algal abundance under ocean acidification can lead to improved conditions for calcification in downstream habitats, depending on reef size, water residence time and circulation patterns. Although the carbon fluxes of benthic reef communities cannot significantly counter changes in carbon chemistry at the scale of oceans, they provide a significant mechanism of buffering ocean acidification impacts at the scale of habitat to reef.","tags":null,"title":"Coral reefs modify their seawater carbon chemistry – implications for impacts of ocean acidification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["JA Kleypas","KRN Anthony","J-P Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293836400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293836400,"objectID":"ad1ff36331cfc2cfd61628a52b5e7d38","permalink":"/publication/kleypas-2011-c/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kleypas-2011-c/","section":"publication","summary":"Changes in the carbonate chemistry of coral reef waters are driven by carbon fluxes from two sources: concentrations of CO2 in the atmospheric and source water, and the primary production/respiration and calcification/dissolution of the benthic community. Recent model analyses have shown that, depending on the composition of the reef community, the air-sea flux of CO2 driven by benthic community processes can exceed that due to increases in atmospheric CO2 (ocean acidification). We field test this model and examine the role of three key members of benthic reef communities in modifying the chemistry of the ocean source water: corals, macroalgae, and sand. Building on data from previous carbon flux studies along a reef-flat transect in Moorea (French Polynesia), we illustrate that the drawdown of total dissolved inorganic carbon (CT) due to photosynthesis and calcification of reef communities can exceed the draw down of total alkalinity (AT) due to calcification of corals and calcifying algae, leading to a net increase in aragonite saturation state (Ωa). We use the model to test how changes in atmospheric CO2 forcing and benthic community structure affect the overall calcification rates on the reef flat. Results show that between the preindustrial period and 1992, ocean acidification caused reef flat calcification rates to decline by an estimated 15%, but loss of coral cover caused calcification rates to decline by at least three times that amount. The results also show that the upstream–downstream patterns of carbonate chemistry were affected by the spatial patterns of benthic community structure. Changes in the ratio of photosynthesis to calcification can thus partially compensate for ocean acidification, at least on shallow reef flats. With no change in benthic community structure, however, ocean acidification depressed net calcification of the reef flat consistent with findings of previous studies.","tags":null,"title":"Coral reefs modify their seawater carbon chemistry- Case study from a barrier reef (Moorea, French Polynesia)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Martin","S Richier","ML Pedrotti","S Dupont","C Castejon","Y Gerakis","M-E Kerros","F Oberhänsli","J-L Teyssié","R Jeffree","J-P Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293836400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293836400,"objectID":"44e81760b8196c78f5431a1f293561dd","permalink":"/publication/martin-2011-a/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/martin-2011-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Ocean acidification is predicted to have significant effects on benthic calcifying invertebrates and in particular on their early developmental stages.

The effects of decreased pH (elevated pCO2) were investigated through physiological and molecular analyses on both embryonic and larval stages. Eggs and larvae were reared in Mediterranean seawater at six pH levels, i.e. pHTof 8.1, 7.9, 7.7, 7.5, 7.25, and 7.0. Fertilization success, survival, growth and calcification rate were monitored over a 3 day period. The expression of genes coding for key proteins involved in development and biomineralization was also monitored. P. Lividus appears to be extremely resistant to low pH with no effect on fertilization success and larval survival. Larval growth was slowed when exposed to low pH but with no direct impact on relative larval morphology or calcification down to pHT 7.25. Consequently, at a given time, larvae exposed to low pH were present at a normal but delayed larval stage. More surprisingly, candidate genes involved in development and biomineralization were up-regulated by factors of up to 26 at low pH.

Although these studies have shown decreased growth rates and increased proportions of abnormal development under low pH conditions, they did not allow discriminating between the direct physiological impact of pH decrease alone and the impact on calcification resulting from aragonite undersaturation, on the larval development of these species. In the present study, we aim at assessing the impact of various modifications in the carbonate chemistry by manipulating separately pH and total alkalinity on the growth of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) larvae during the first 3 days of development (until shelled D-­‐veliger larvae). Results showed that the developmental success (percentage of eggs developing to a viable D-­‐veliger larvae) and growth rates were not directly affected by pH decreases but more likely by the associated decreases in aragonite saturation levels. In contrast to previous studies, both hatching and growth rates were not significantly altered as long as seawater remained saturated with respect to aragonite, and strongly decreased below saturation levels. These results suggest that the mechanisms potentially used by these organisms to regulate calcification rates are not efficient enough to cope for the low availability of carbonate ions under corrosive conditions.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of carbonate chemistry alteration on the early embryonic development of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Fiorini","JJ Middelburg","J-P Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293836400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293836400,"objectID":"dff45aad4003cb28d9660c91d6fd616d","permalink":"/publication/fiorini-2011-b/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fiorini-2011-b/","section":"publication","summary":"The effects of elevated partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and temperature on the cocco­lithophore Syracosphaera pulchra were investigated in isolation and in combination.

In this study, we investigated the effects of increased levels of pCO2 (380, 850 and 500 ppmv corresponding to pHT of 8.1, 7.85 and 7.60) on the accumulation of dissolved 110mAg, 109Cd, 57Co, 203Hg, 54Mn and 65Zn in the whole egg strand and in the different egg compartments during the whole period of development and in the hatchlings during their first days of the paralarval life. In the embryo, increasing seawater pCO2 enhanced the uptake of 110mAg and 65Zn and 203Hg showed a minimal concentration factor (CF) at 850 ppmv. The incorporation of 65Zn in statoliths increased with increasing pCO2 following its enhanced metal uptake in the whole body of the embryo and also with the greater size of the statoliths that occurred with their exposure to 850 and 1500 ppmv, compared to 380 ppmv. The more 110mAg, 203Hg and 65Zn accumulated in the embryo, the lower were their CF values in the eggshell, suggesting that the retention properties of the eggshell were affected by pCO2. The uptake of 109Cd and 54Mn in embryo and the eggshell decreased as a function of increasing pCO2 and the accumulation of 57Co in embryos was not affected by the pCO2 conditions. After 52 h of exposure, the steady-state equilibrium value of 110mAg CF in paralarvae increased with increasing pCO2, while the CF for 57Co was reduced at 1500 ppmv.

B/Ca compositions measured using laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) show that boron uptake by C. caespitosa cultured at different pCO2 regimes is independent of ambient seawater pH, being mainly controlled by temperature-dependent calcification. In contrast, the boron isotope compositions (δ11Bcarb) of the full suite of corals determined by positive thermal ionisation mass spectrometry (PTIMS) show a clear trend of decreasing δ11Bcarb (from 26.7‰ to 22.2‰) with decreasing seawater pH, reflecting the strong pH dependence of the boron isotope system. The δ11Bcarb compositions together with measurements of ambient seawater parameters enable calibration of the boron pH proxy for C. caespitosa, by using a new approach that defines the relationship between ambient seawater pH (pHsw) and the internally controlled pH at the site of calcification (pHbiol). C. caespitosa exhibits a linear relationship between pHsw and the shift in pH due to physiological processes, ΔpH, giving the regression ΔpHClad = – 0.52pHsw + 4.80. We further apply this method (\"ΔpH—pHsw\") to calibrate tropical species of Porites, Acropora, and Stylophora reported in the literature. The temperate and tropical species calibrations are all linearly correlated (r2  0.9) and the biological fractionation component (ΔpH) between species varies within ~0.2 pH units. Our \"ΔpH—pHsw\" approach provides a robust and accurate tool to reconstruct palaeoseawater pH for both temperate and tropical corals, further validating the boron fractionation factor (αB3-B4 = 1.0272) determined experimentally by Klochko et al.

A typical spring bloom was encountered, where maximum of gross primary production (GPP) was followed by maxima of bacterial respiration (BR) and production (BP). The trophic balance (heterotrophy vs. autotrophy) of the system did not exhibit any seasonal trend although a strong intra-annual variability was observed. On average, the community tended to be net heterotrophic with a GPP threshold for a balanced metabolism of 1.1 μmol O2 l−1 d−1. Extended forest fires in summer 2003 and a local episodic upwelling in July 2003 likely supplied orthophosphate and nitrate into the system. These events were associated with an enhanced bacterioplankton production (up to 2.4-fold), respiration (up to 4.5-fold) and growth efficiency (up to 2.9-fold) but had no effect on GPP. A Sahara dust wet deposition event in February 2004 stimulated bacterial abundance, production and growth efficiency but not GPP. Our study suggests that short-term disturbances such as wind-driven upwelling, forest fires and Sahara dust depositions can have a significant but previously not sufficiently considered influence on phytoplankton- and bacterioplankton-mediated ecosystem functions and can modify or even mask the seasonal dynamics. The study also indicates that atmospheric deposition of nutrients and particles not only impacts phytoplankton but also bacterioplankton and could, at times, also shift systems stronger towards net heterotrophy.","tags":null,"title":"Autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism of microbial planktonic communities in an oligotrophic coastal marine ecosystem: seasonal dynamics and episodic events","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Fiorini","J-P Gattuso","P van Rijswijk","JJ Middelburg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262300400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262300400,"objectID":"7dadb2ea5540678d3d73ef1ee6c983ee","permalink":"/publication/fiorini-2010-b/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fiorini-2010-b/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Coccolithophores lipid and carbon isotope composition and their variability related to changes in seawater carbonate chemistry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A-M Nisumaa","S Pesant","RGJ Bellerby","JJ Middelburg","JC Orr","U Riebesell","T Tyrrell","D Wolf-Gladrow","J-P Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262300400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262300400,"objectID":"3527eb0f6a5fe07d83d10da9675436ba","permalink":"/publication/nisumaa-2010-b/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/nisumaa-2010-b/","section":"publication","summary":"The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the oceans has led to a rise in the oceanic partial pressure of CO2, and to a decrease in pH and carbonate ion concentration. This modification of the marine carbonate system is referred to as ocean acidification. Numerous papers report the effects of ocean acidification on marine organisms and communities but few have provided details concerning full carbonate chemistry and complementary observations. Additionally, carbonate system variables are often reported in different units, calculated using different sets of dissociation constants and on different pH scales. Hence the direct comparison of experimental results has been problematic and often misleading. The need was identified to (1) gather data on carbonate chemistry, biological and biogeochemical properties, and other ancillary data from published experimental data, (2) transform the information into common framework, and (3) make data freely available. The present paper is the outcome of an effort to integrate ocean carbonate chemistry data from the literature which has been supported by the European Network of Excellence for Ocean Ecosystems Analysis (EUR-OCEANS) and the European Project on Ocean Acidification (EPOCA). A total of 185 papers were identified, 100 contained enough information to readily compute carbonate chemistry variables, and 81 data sets were archived at PANGAEA – The Publishing Network for Geoscientific \u0026 Environmental Data.

Among the changes of the carbonate system are an increase in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and a decline of pH; hence, the whole process is often referred to as ‘ocean acidification’. Many microbial processes can be affected either directly or indirectly via a cascade of effects through the response of non-microbial groups and/or through changes in seawater chemistry. We briefly review the current understanding of the impact of ocean acidification on microbial diversity and pro- cesses, and highlight the gaps that need to be addressed in future research. The focus is on Bacteria, Archaea, viruses and protistan grazers but also includes total primary production of phytoplankton as well as species composition of eukaryotic phytoplankton. Some species and communities exhibit increased primary production at elevated pCO2. In contrast to their heterocystous counterparts, nitro- gen fixation by non-heterocystous cyanobacteria is stimulated by elevated pCO2. The experimental data on the response of prokaryotic production to ocean acidification are not consistent. Very few other microbial processes have been investigated at environmentally relevant pH levels. The poten- tial for microbes to adapt to ocean acidification, at either the species level by genetic change or at the community level through the replacement of sensitive species or groups by non- or less sensitive ones, is completely unknown. Consequently, the impact of ocean acidification on keystone species and microbial diversity needs to be elucidated. Most experiments used a short-term perturbation approach by using cultured organisms; few were conducted in mesocosms and none in situ. There is likely a lot to be learned from observations in areas naturally enriched with CO2, such as vents, upwelling and near-shore areas.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of ocean acidification on microbial diversity, and on microbe-driven biogeochemistry and ecosystem functioning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F Gazeau","J-P Gattuso","C Dawber","AE Pronker","F Peene","J Peene","CH Heip","JJ Middelburg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262300400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262300400,"objectID":"4a9ef05381a4250da8301b18b3cd59c0","permalink":"/publication/gazeau-2010-b/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gazeau-2010-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Several experiments have shown a decrease of growth and calcification of organisms at decreased pH levels. There is a growing interest to focus on early life stages that are believed to be more sensitive to environmental disturbances such as hypercapnia. Here, we present experimental data, acquired in a commercial hatchery, demonstrating that the growth of planktonic mussel (Mytilus edulis) larvae is significantly affected by a decrease of pH to a level expected for the end of the century. Even though there was no significant effect of a 0.25–0.34 pH unit decrease on hatching and mortality rates during the first 2 days of development nor during the following 13-day period prior to settlement, final shells were respectively 4.5±1.3 and 6.0±2.3% smaller at pHNBS~7.8 (pCO2~1100–1200 μatm) than at a control pHNBS of ~8.1 (pCO2~460–640 μatm). Moreover, a decrease of 12.0±5.4% of shell thickness was observed after 15d of development. More severe impacts were found with a decrease of ~0.5 pHNBS unit during the first 2 days of development which could be attributed to a decrease of calcification due to a slight undersaturation of seawater with respect to aragonite. Indeed, important effects on both hatching and D-veliger shell growth were found. Hatching rates were 24±4% lower while D-veliger shells were 12.7±0.9% smaller at pHNBS~7.6 (pCO2~1900 μatm) than at a control pHNBS of ~8.1 (pCO2~540 μatm). Although these results show that blue mussel larvae are still able to develop a shell in seawater undersaturated with respect to aragonite, the observed decreases of hatching rates and shell growth could lead to a significant decrease of the settlement success. As the environmental conditions considered in this study do not necessarily reflect the natural conditions experienced by this species at the time of spawning, future studies will need to consider the whole larval cycle (from fertilization to settlement) under environmentally relevant conditions in order to investigate the potential ecological and economical losses of a decrease of this species fitness in the field.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of ocean acidification on the early life stages of the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S Comeau","G Gorsky","S Alliouane","J-P Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262300400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262300400,"objectID":"3a9f99b618958c2e08e4c36afe514031","permalink":"/publication/comeau-2010-f/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/comeau-2010-f/","section":"publication","summary":"Larvae of the Mediterranean pteropod Cavolinia inXexa were maintained at controlled pHT values of 8.1, 7.82 and 7.51, equivalent, respectively, to pCO2 levels of 380, 857 and 1,713 􏰟atm.

The effect of changes in the seawater chemistry was investigated on Limacina helicina, a key species of Arctic pelagic ecosystems. Individuals were kept in the laboratory under controlled pCO2 levels of 280, 380, 550, 760 and 1020 µatm and at control (0°C) and elevated (4°C) temperatures. The respiration rate was unaffected by pCO2 at control temperature, but significantly increased as a function of the pCO2 level at elevated temperature. pCO2 had no effect on the gut clearance rate at either temperature. Precipitation of CaCO3, measured as the incorporation of 45Ca, significantly declined as a function of pCO2 at both temperatures. The decrease in calcium carbonate precipitation was highly correlated to the aragonite saturation state. Even though this study demonstrates that pteropods are able to precipitate calcium carbonate at low aragonite saturation state, the results support the current concern for the future of Arctic pteropods, as the production of their shell appears to be very sensitive to decreased pH.

We found that the seasonal change in temperature was the predominant factor controlling the physiology and growth of C. caespitosa, while an increase in pCO2, alone or in combination with global warming, had no significant effect on photosynthesis, photosynthetic efficiency and calcification.

In contrast to all other elements analysed so far, there is no relationship between the Li isotopic compositions and the skeletal ultrastructure. This implies that the biomineralization mechanisms, which are supposed to be different in the early mineralization zones and the fibers, do not influence the Li isotopic composition in corals. In particular, the model of Rayleigh fractionation in a semi-closed calcifying fluid is not compatible with the homogeneity of the Li isotope compositions at the micrometer scale.

Algal necroses appeared at the end of summer under elevated temperature ﬁrst at 700 ppm (60% of the thallus surface) and then at 400 ppm (30%). The death of algae was observed only under elevated temperature and was two- to threefold higher under elevated pCO2. During the ﬁrst month of the experiment, net calciﬁcation was signiﬁcantly reduced under elevated pCO2. At the end of the summer period, net calciﬁcation decreased by 50% when both temperature and pCO2 were elevated while no effect was found under elevated tem- perature and elevated pCO2 alone. In autumn and winter, net calciﬁcation in healthy algae increased with increasing temperature, independently of the pCO2 level, while necroses and death in the algal population caused a net dissolution at elevated temperature and pCO2. The dissolution of dead algal thalli was affected by elevated pCO2, being two- to fourfold higher than under ambient pCO2. These results suggest that net dissolution is likely to exceed net calciﬁcation in L. cabiochae by the end of this century. This could have major consequences in terms of biodiversity and biogeochem- istry in coralligenous communities dominated by these algae.","tags":null,"title":"Response of Mediterranean coralline algae to ocean acidification and elevated temperature","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J-P Gattuso","H Lavigne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230764400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230764400,"objectID":"7461dd43de6cd332f3d1bb63f1ba13c3","permalink":"/publication/gattuso-2009-i/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gattuso-2009-i/","section":"publication","summary":"Although future changes in the seawater carbonate chemistry are well constrained, their impact on marine organisms and ecosystems remains poorly known. The biological response to ocean acidification is a recent field of research as most purposeful experiments have only been carried out in the late 1990s. The potentially dire consequences of ocean acidification attract scientists and students with a limited knowledge of the carbonate chemistry and its experimental manipulation. Hence, some guidelines on carbonate chemistry manipulations may be helpful for the growing ocean acidification community to maintain comparability. Perturbation experiments are one of the key approaches used to investigate the biological response to elevated pCO2. They are based on measurements of physiological or metabolic processes in organisms and communities exposed to seawater with normal or altered carbonate chemistry. Seawater chemistry can be manipulated in different ways depending on the facilities available and on the question being addressed. The goal of this paper is (1) to examine the benefits and drawbacks of various manipulation techniques and (2) to describe a new version of the R software package seacarb which includes new functions aimed at assisting the design of ocean acidification perturbation experiments. Three approaches closely mimic the on-going and future changes in the seawater carbonate chemistry: gas bubbling, addition of high-CO2 seawater as well as combined additions of acid and bicarbonate and/or carbonate.","tags":null,"title":"Technical Note: Approaches and software tools to investigate the impact of ocean acidification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["O Bonilla-Findji","G.

Seawater was sequentially filtered and concentrated to produce a bacterial concentrate, a viral concentrate and a virus-free ultrafiltrate. The combination of all three fractions served as treatments with active viruses. Heating or microwaving was used to inactivate viruses for the control treatments. Despite the differences in the initial trophic state and community composition of the study sites, consistent trends were found. In the presence of active viruses, BR was stimulated (up to 113%), whereas BP and BGE were reduced (up to 51%). Our results suggest that viruses enhance the role of bacteria as oxidizers of organic matter, hence as producers of CO2, and remineralizers of CO2, N, P and Fe. In the context of Fe-fertilization, this has important implications for the final fate of organic carbon in marine systems.","tags":null,"title":"Viral effects on bacterial respiration, production and growth efficiency: consistent trends in the Southern Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

However, obtaining these estimates often demands significant amounts of time and manpower. Here we present a simplified way to obtain an estimation of ecosystem metabolism. We used artificial neural networks (ANNs) to develop a mathematical model of the gross primary production to community respiration ratio (GPP:CR) based on input variables derived from three widely contrasting European coastal ecosystems (Scheldt Estuary, Randers Fjord, and Bay of Palma). Although very large gradients of nutrient concentration, light penetration, and organic-matter concentration exist across the sites, the factors that best predict the GPP:CR ratio are sampling depth, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and temperature. We propose that, at least in coastal ecosystems, metabolic balance can be predicted relatively easily from these three predictive factors. An important conclusion of this work is that ANNs can provide a robust tool for the determination of ecosystem metabolism in coastal ecosystems.","tags":null,"title":"Artificial neural network analysis of factors controlling ecosystem metabolism in coastal marine environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J-P Gattuso","S.

Fair weather conditions prevailed over the study period as indicated by oceanographic (temperature, salinity, and current velocity and direction) and meteorological variables, which validated the standing water hypothesis. This temperate ecosystem exhibited high community gross primary production (GPP = 519 ± 106 mmol C m–2 d–1, n = 6) and also supported high rates of community respiration (R). As a result, the system was slightly autotrophic (net community production, NCP = 20 mmol C m–2 d–1), with a GPP/R ratio of 1.06. NCP exhibited circadian variations with 2- to 3-fold changes in community respiration, both in the light and in the dark. Rates of net community calcification also exhibited circadian variations, with positive rates (up to 24 mmol CaCO3 m–2 h–1) for irradiance values 300 W m–2 (about 1380 µmol photon m–2 s–1). Below this irradiance threshold, net community dissolution prevailed. Daily net calcification (G) was on average 8 mmol CaCO3 m–2 d–1. CO2 fluxes generated by primary production, respiration, and calcification suggest that the study site was a potential atmospheric CO2 sink of 15 mmol CO2 m–2 d–1 at the time of measurement.","tags":null,"title":"Community primary production and calcification in a NW Mediterranean ecosystem dominated by calcareous macroalgae","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F Gazeau","C Quiblier","JM Jansen","J-P Gattuso","JJ Middelburg","CHR Heip"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167606000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167606000,"objectID":"88974cdcd2d12744d9d75f8a9a54773d","permalink":"/publication/gazeau-2007-c/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gazeau-2007-c/","section":"publication","summary":"Ocean acidification resulting from human emissions of carbon dioxide has already lowered and will further lower surface ocean pH.

Four regions are considered: the Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea and the European Atlantic coast including the North Sea. The metabolic database (194 papers) suffers from a non-homogeneous geographical coverage with no usable data for the Black Sea which was therefore excluded from this part of our study. Pelagic gross primary production in European open shelves is, by far, the most documented parameter with an estimated mean of 41 mmol C m?2d?1, the lowest value is reported in the Mediterranean Sea (21 mmol C m?2d?1) and the highest one in the Atlantic/North Sea area (51 mmol C m?2d?1). Microphytobenthic primary production, mostly measured in shallow areas, is extrapolated to the entire 0–200 m depth range. Its contribution to total primary production is low in all regions (mean: 1.5 mmol C m?2d?1). Although macrophyte beds are very productive, a regional production estimate is not provided in this study because their geographical distribution along the European coastline remains unknown. Measurements of pelagic community respiration are clearly too sparse, especially below the euphotic zone, to yield an accurate picture of the fate of organic matter produced in the water column. With a mean value of 17 mmol C m?2d?1, benthic community respiration consumes approximately 40% of the pelagic organic matter production. Estuaries generally exhibit high metabolic rates and a large range of variation in all parameters, except microphytobenthic primary production. Finally, the problem of eutrophication in Europe is discussed and the metabolic data obtained in the framework of the Land–Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) project are compared with available direct measurements of net ecosystem production.","tags":null,"title":"The European coastal zone: characterization and first assessment of ecosystem metabolism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

The contents of chlorophyll c2and protein remained constant throughout the experiment, while the chlorophyll acontent was significantly affected by temperature, and was higher under the ‘high-temperature-high- pCO 2’ condition. The cell-specific density was higher at ‘high pCO 2’ than at ‘normal pCO 2’ (1.7 vs. 1.4). The net photosynthesis normalized per unit protein was affected by both temperature and pCO 2, whereas respiration was not affected by the treatments. Calcification decreased by 50% when temperature and pCO 2were both elevated. Calcification under normal temperature did not change in response to an increased pCO 2. This is not in agreement with numerous published papers that describe a negative relationship between marine calcification and CO 2. The confounding effect of temperature has the potential to explain a large portion of the variability of the relationship between calcification and pCO 2reported in the literature, and warrants a re-evaluation of the projected decrease of marine calcification by the year 2100.","tags":null,"title":"Interacting effects of CO|2| partial pressure and temperature on photosynthesis and calcification in a scleractinian coral","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Sciandra","J Harlay","D Lefèvre","R Lemée","P Rimmelin","M Denis","J-P Gattuso"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1041375600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1041375600,"objectID":"ba5d55da4569ef3f18bc74bd1104cb6a","permalink":"/publication/sciandra-2003-c/","publishdate":"2003-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sciandra-2003-c/","section":"publication","summary":"Precipitation of calcium carbonate by phytoplankton in the photic oceanic layer is an important process regulating the carbon cycling and the exchange of CO2 at the ocean-atmosphere interface. Previous experiments have demonstrated that, under nutrient-sufficient conditions, dou- bling the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in seawater—a likely scenario for the end of the century— can significantly decrease both the rate of calcification by coccolithophorids and the ratio of inorganic to organic carbon production. The present work investigates the effects of high pCO2 on calcification by the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi (Strain TW1) grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a situation that can also prevail in the ocean. Nitrogen limitation was achieved in NO3-limited contin- uous cultures renewed at the rate of 0.5 d–1 and exposed to a saturating light level. pCO2 was increased from 400 to 700 ppm and controlled by bubbling CO2-rich or CO2-free air into the cultures. The pCO2 shift has a rapid effect on cell physiology that occurs within 2 cell divisions subsequent to the perturbation. Net calcification rate (C) decreased by 25% and, in contrast to previous studies with N-replete cultures, gross community production (GCP) and dark community respiration (DCR) also decreased.

Two sets of corals were grown with filtered seawater under high-light, controlled conditions. One group of corals was fed Artemia salina nauplii three times a week over twelve weeks, and compared to a control group that was not fed. Fed corals exhibited higher levels of chlorophyll and protein as well as higher calcification rates than starved colonies. The net photosynthetic rate was higher in starved than in fed corals, but the respiration rate was not different between the two treatments. d13C and d15N values of nauplii Artemia used for coral feeding were -12‰ and 6.6‰ respectively. d13C values of zooxanthellae were significantly heavier than those of coral tissues, for both fed (-10.1 vs. -11.7‰) and un-fed colonies (-10.9 vs. -13.2‰). Isotopic data reflected the incorporation of Artemia carbon into the coral tissue in that the d13C of host tissues was significantly heavier in fed than in un-fed colonies (-11.7 to -13.2‰ respectively), although there was less difference in the d13C of the zooxanthellae fraction between the two groups. In contract to carbon, d15N values were not significantly different between fed and starved colonies either in the host tissue (3.5‰), or in zooxanthellae (3.8‰). This suggests that even when fed, the coral relied on other sources of nitrogen such as the external dissolved inorganic nitrogen pool, and was able to conserve organic nitrogen efficiently between host and symbiont, at least under the high light conditions used hereSkeletal d13C signature was not significantly different between fed and unfed colonies (mean = –4.6‰). Skeletal d18O composition was however significantly different between the two treatments (-4.24 to -4.05‰ for fed and starved colonies respectively). A simple model is presented to summarize how various sources of carbon (inorganic, photosynthate and prey) flow through the coral colony and are reflected in isotopic signatures. The carbon isotopic signature of the coral tissue itself may be a useful index of relative use of prey and translocated carbon.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of feeding on the carbon, oxygen and nitrogen isotopic composition of the tissues and skeleton of the zooxanthellate coral Stylophora pistillata","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

These data clearly showed the wide range of BGE that can be experienced at 1 site on an annual timescale in the surface mixed layer and suggest that several factors (concentrations of inorganic nutrients and DOC) control BGE at this site.

It has been shown that [delta]13C can be affected by light, seawater [delta]13CDIC, nutrition, respiration, spawning, pH and temperature. We investigated the effect of light on photosynthesis, respiration, calcification, and stable isotope composition ([delta]13C and [delta]18O) of the skeleton in the zooxanthellate scleractinian corals Acropora sp. and Stylophora pistillata. Colonies were grown on glass slides under controlled conditions in the laboratory at low and high light (LL and HL: 132 and 258 [mu]mol photons m-2 s-1). The average net photosynthesis of Acropora sp. was significantly higher under HL than under LL. The difference was not statistically significant for S. pistillata. The respiration rate did not change significantly in both species under the two light conditions. The calcification rate of S. pistillata under HL was 17-fold higher than under LL and 2.5-fold higher for Acropora sp. The average skeletal [delta]13C and [delta]18O of Acropora sp. were significantly more negative under LL than under HL. For S. pistillata, skeletal [delta]18O was significantly more negative in the LL than in the HL condition. The [delta]13C value of the skeleton deposited under LL was also more negative than under HL, although the difference was not statistically significant. The skeletal [delta]13C was significantly correlated with the rate of calcification, both in LL and HL. No correlation was found between skeletal [delta]13C and the following other physiological parameters: net and gross photosynthesis (Pn and Pg), respiration (R), and the Pg/R ratio. The increase of skeletal [delta]13C with increasing light seems to support the model of Goreau (1977). Zooxanthellae mostly fix 12C under HL, leading to an increased concentration of 13C in the common carbon pool which supplies dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) for calcification. Hence, the skeleton deposited is isotopically enriched in 13C. This general model needs revision to accommodate the recent finding that calcification and photosynthesis draw carbon from two reservoirs (seawater and metabolic DIC), and that respiratory CO2 is the major source of DIC for calcification. It is suggested that zooxanthellae mostly fix 12C[DIC] in LL; the organic matter respired, the CO2 released, and the CaCO3 deposited being therefore isotopically light. Under HL condition, zooxanthellar photosynthesis uses both [12C]- and [13C]DIC. The photosynthetic products catabolized by the coral, as well the respiratory CO2 and the CaCO3 precipitated are therefore heavier.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of light on skeletal ∂13C and ∂18O, and interaction with photosynthesis, respiration and calcification in two zooxanthellate scleractinian corals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

We have investigated the response of a coral reef community dominated by scleractinian corals, but also including other calcifying organisms such as calcareous algae, crustaceans, gastropods and echinoderms, and kept in an open-top mesocosm. Seawater pCO2 was modified by manipulating the pCO2 of air used to bubble the mesocosm. The aragonite saturation state (Warag) of the seawater in the mesocosm varied between 1.3 and 5.4. Community calcification decreased as a function of increasing pCO2 and decreasing Warag. This result is in agreement with previous data collected on scleractinian corals, coralline algae and in a reef mesocosm, even though some of these studies did not manipulate CO2 directly. Our data suggest that the rate of calcification during the last glacial maximum might have been 114% of the preindustrial rate. Moreover, using the average emission scenario (IS92a) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we predict that the calcification rate of scleractinian-dominated communities may decrease by 21% between the pre-industrial period (year 1880) and the time at which pCO2 will double (year 2065).","tags":null,"title":"CO|2| partial pressure controls the calcification rate of a coral community","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J-P Gattuso","S.

The main questions were: (1) what is the exposure time needed to induce measurable change in growth rate? (2) which are the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus required to cause changes in these rates? (3) what is the recovery potential of the corals after the nutrient stress? For this purpose, three tanks (N, P, NP) were enriched with ammonium (N), phosphorus (P) or both nutrients (NP), respectively. A fourth tank (C) served as a control. The growth of 40 nubbins (10 in each tank) was monitored during four periods: period 1 (nutrient-poor conditions), period 2 (10 µm NH4 and/or 2 µm PO4 enrichment), period 3 (20 µm NH4 and/or 2 µm PO4) and period 4 (nutrient-poor conditions). Period 4 was performed to study the recovery potential of corals after a nutrient stress. During period 1, growth rates remained constant in all tanks. In the P tank, growth rates declined during the two enrichment periods, with a total decrease of 60% by the end of period 3. In the N tank, growth rates remained nearly constant during period 2 but decreased in period 3 (60% decrease). In the NP tank, 50% and 25% decreases were observed during periods 2 and 3. At the end of the recovery period, a regain in growth rate was observed in the N and NP tanks (35 and 30% increase, respectively, compared with the rates measured at the end of period 3) and growth rates returned to 60% of the initial rates. By contrast, in the P tank, there was no regain in growth and a further decrease of 5% was observed. Rates of photosynthesis were often higher during the enriched than the nutrient-poor period (up to 150% increase). Corals with the highest percent increases in maximal gross photosynthetic rate (Pgmax) had the smallest decreases in growth rate due to nutrient enrichment. In conclusion, high ammonium (20 µm) and relatively low phosphorus concentrations (2 µm) are required to induce a significant decrease in coral growth rate. The largest reduction was observed with both ammonium and phosphorus enrichment. The decrease in growth rate was rapid following nutrient enrichment, since a 10% decrease or more could be observed after the first week of treatment.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of nutrient enrichment on growth and photosynthesis of the zooxanthellate coral Stylophora pistillata","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J-P Gattuso","RW Buddemeier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":946681200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":946681200,"objectID":"bf76293dc3b74a77246a1bddd2832ddc","permalink":"/publication/gattuso-2000/","publishdate":"2000-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gattuso-2000/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Ocean biogeochemistry: calcification and CO|2|","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

The underlying assumptions of each technique are examined to assess the recent claim that the most widely used technique in coral reefs (pH-total alkalinity), may have provided spurious results in the past because of high rates of nitrification and release of phosphoric acid in the water column [Chisholm, J. R. M. \u0026 Barnes, D. J. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95, 6566-6569]. At least three lines of evidence suggest that this claim is not founded. First, the rate of nitrification required to explain the discrepancy between the two methods recently reported is not realistic as it is much higher than the rates measured in another reef system and greater than the highest rate measured in a marine environment. Second, fluxes of ammonium, nitrate, and phosphorus are not consistent with high rates of nitrification and release of phosphoric acid. Third, the consistency of the metabolic parameters obtained by using the two techniques is in good agreement in two sites recently investigated. The pH-total alkalinity technique therefore appears to be applicable in most coral reef systems. Consequently, the conclusion that most coral reef flats are sources of CO2 to the atmosphere does not need revision. Furthermore, we provide geochemical evidence that calcification in coral reefs, as well as in other calcifying ecosystems, is a long-term source of CO2 for the atmosphere.","tags":null,"title":"Measurement of community metabolism and significance of coral reefs in the CO|2| source-sink debate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

The supply of carbon to calcification is almost unknown, but metabolic CO2 seems to be a major source of inorganic carbon. Calcium supply to calcification is thought to be mainly a diffusional process, the only active membrane transport would occur between the calicoblastic cells and the site of calcification. Photosynthesis and calcification are tightly coupled in zooxanthellate scleractinian corals and coral reef communities. Calcification is on average 3.8 times higher in the light than in darkness. The recent suggestion that calcification is dark-repressed rather than light-enhanced is not supported by the literature and requires further investigation. There is a very strong correlation between photosynthesis and calcification at the organism and community levels but their ratio is different from 1. The ratio of calcification vs gross photosynthesis is 0.71 in corals and 0.22 in reef communities.The effect of global climatic (pCO2 and temperature) changes on the rate of calcification is also reviewed. Available evidence demonstrates that the rate of calcification decreases as a function of increasing pCO2 and decreasing calcium carbonate saturation state in various calcifying photosynthetic organisms and communities. The potential decrease of CaCO3 deposition is estimated using the scenarios considered by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The results suggest that the rate of calcification may have decreased by 10% between 1880 and 1990 and that it may decrease by 9-30% (mid estimate: 22%) from 1990 to 2100. Inadequate understanding of the mechanism of calcification and its interaction with photosynthesis severely limit the ability to provide an accurate prediction of future changes in the rate of calcification.","tags":null,"title":"Photosynthesis and calcification at cellular, organismal and community levels in coral reefs: a review on interactions and control by carbonate chemistry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

It exhibits a wide diversity of geomorphological types and ecosystems, each one displaying great variability in terms of physical and biogeochemical forcings. Despite its relatively modest surface area, the coastal zone plays a considerable role in the biogeochemical cycles because it receives massive inputs of terrestrial organic matter and nutrients, is among the most geochemically and biologically active areas of the biosphere, and exchanges large amounts of matter and energy with the open ocean. Coastal ecosystems have therefore attracted much attention recently and are the focus of several current national and international research programs (e.g. LOICZ, ELOISE). The primary production, respiration, calcification, carbon burial and exchange with adjacent systems, including the atmosphere, are reviewed for the major coastal ecosystems (estuaries, macrophyte communities, mangroves, coral reefs, and the remaining continental shelf). All ecosystems examined, except estuaries, are net autotrophic. The contribution of the coastal zone to the global carbon cycle both during pristine times and at present is difficult to assess due to the limited metabolic data available as well as because of major uncertainties concerning the magnitude of processes such as respiration, exchanges at the open ocean boundary, and air-sea fluxes of biogases.","tags":null,"title":"Carbon and carbonate metabolism in coastal aquatic ecosystems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Recent reports, however, suggest that it could play a major role in the evolution and biogeography of recent corals. We investigated the calcification rates of five colonies of the zooxanthellate coral Stylophora pistillata in synthetic seawater using the alkalinity anomaly technique. Changes in aragonite saturation from 98% to 585% were obtained by manipulating the calcium concentration. The results show a nonlinear increase in calcification rate as a function of aragonite saturation level. Calcification increases nearly 3-fold when aragonite saturation increases from 98% to 390%, i.e., close to the typical present saturation state of tropical seawater. There is no further increase of calcification at saturation values above this threshold. Preliminary data suggest that another coral species, Acropora sp., displays a similar behaviour. These experimental results suggest: (1) that the rate of calcification does not change significantly within the range of saturation levels corresponding to the last glacial-interglacial cycle, and (2) that it may decrease significantly in the future as a result of the decrease in the saturation level due to anthropogenic release of CO2 into the atmosphere.

The effect of light on the feeding rates was also investigated. Grazing experiments were first conducted by exposing coral colonies to known amounts of super(3)H-thymidine-labeled bacteria and ciliates and measuring the appearance of radioactivity in coral tissues. A method was developed to obtain clean cultures of super(3)H-labeled ciliates. Results showed that 7% of the labeled bacteria and 90% of the labeled ciliates were ingested after 4-6 h incubation. Corals were then incubated in medium containing different concentrations of unlabeled ciliates (200, 500, 800 cells ml super(-1)). Replicates of each concentration were exposed to one of three light levels (0, 80, 250 mu mol m super(-2) s super(-1)). Coral feeding rate increased with prey density, from 1.40 to 4.10 x 10 super(4) ciliates (0.22-0.65 mu g C mg protein super(-1) h super(-1)) for 200-800 ciliates ml super(-1), respectively. However, a plateau was observed after a total ingestion of 4 x 10 super(4) ciliates (1.7 mu gC mg protein super(-1)). The total number of ciliates ingested, as well as the ingestion rates decreased when the light intensity increased. During dark experiments, the maximal amount of carbon ingested was twice as much as that ingested in light experiments. However, heterotrophic nutrition occurred even if the colonies could satisfy their carbon metabolism via photosynthesis. Zooplankton feeding seems therefore to complement autotrophic nutrition. Under high light, the small amount of microplankton ingested may provide nitrogen, phosphorus, or vitamins to corals, and this food supply may be especially important in tropical waters where inorganic nutrient concentrations are low. Conversely, when light is limiting, predation may also provide most of the energy necessary for coral maintenance.","tags":null,"title":"Microheterotrophy in the zooxanthellate coral Stylophora pistillata: effect of light and prey density","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Production of POC and PON in the form of mucus has been relatively well studied, but very few data are available on the release of DOC and DON by corals. In order to investigate several aspects of carbon and nutrient cycling in corals, release of DOC and DON by fed and unfed colonies of the zooxanthellate coral Galaxea fascicularis (Linnaeus 1767) was measured in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Colonies were either fed with artemia or supplied with nitrogen- and phosphorus-enriched seawater. We measured DOC and DON fluxes from corals using the high temperature catalytic oxidation method and DOC release as C-14-photosynthate using a radioisotope technique. Corals released significant amounts of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Two large release peaks were observed in mid-morning and mid-afternoon. DOC concentrations increased from ca 100 mu M (background level) to 300-1700 mu M, depending on the size of the colony and the trophic status. DON concentrations also increased from 15 to 120 mu M Release rates varied from 2-3 mu mol DOC and 0.5-0.6 mu mol DON (mg protein)(-1) d(-1) for the unfed colonies to 13-25 mu mol DOC and 1-3 mu mol DON (mg protein)(-1) d(-1) for the artemia-fed colonies to 4-6 mu mol DOC and 0.2-1.3 mu mol DON (mg protein)(-1) d(-1) for the nutrient-enriched colonies. Fed corals therefore released more DOC than unfed colonies, but tended to conserve organic nitrogen, suggesting that heterotrophic nutrition may serve corals as a source of new nutrients. Calculations of the carbon balance for the unfed colonies showed that DOC release represents ca 14% of the net daily photosynthetically fixed carbon. Following each peak in release, concentrations of DOM fell back to routine background levels. The role of free-living, epibiotic and/or intracellular bacteria in the uptake of DOM was therefore investigated. Colonies were labelled with C-14-bicarbonate and the subsequent release of C-14-DOM was followed in filtered seawater treated with and without prokaryotic inhibitors. No subsequent uptake of C-14-DOM was observed in the presence of inhibitors, suggesting that bacteria may play an important role in DOM uptake. This process may lead to tight nutrient recycling within coral colonies and may enable corals to thrive in oligotrophic waters.","tags":null,"title":"Release of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen by the zooxanthellate coral Galaxea fascicularis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

Measurements were made between two reference points separated by a distance corresponding to a growth period of six months, from mid-winter to mid-summer. For each of the two reference points, information concerning the environmental parameters controlling the development of the coral colonies was collected in situ. The variability of the isotopic values recorded from coral skeletons grown in identical physical and chemical conditions cannot be ascribed to technical problems, but may rather be induced by calcification mechanisms. In order to define the influence of calcification processes on oxygen isotopic composition, a simple mathematical model is developed, simulating the behaviour of oxygen isotopes. According to Gladfelter’s studies (1982, 1983, 1984), we infer that the main factors affecting the isotopic ratio of skeletal aragonite in the scleractinian coral Acropora genus are on the one hand the initial quantity of aragonite deposited at the apical part of the branch and consequently the relative amount of primary and secondary aragonite infilling residual pores during coral growth, and on the other hand, the duration of the secondary aragonite infilling. Comparisons between the measured and the calculated isotopic profiles reveal that differences in calcification processes account for isotopic discrepancies encountered in the different colonies analysed.

A procedure is proposed to estimate the potential CO2 exchange with the atmosphere by taking into account both the saturation level of oceanic seawater and the equilibration process occurring after water leaves the reef. It is shown that both sites were net sources of CO2 to the atmosphere as a result of the effect of calcification on the dynamics of the inorganic carbon system. The potential global CO2 evasion from the ocean to the atmosphere is about 4 times higher at Yonge Reef than at Moorea. It is also demonstrated that, at both sites, the major exchange of CO2 from sea to air occurs as seawater returns to chemical equilibrium after it has crossed and left the reef. The dynamics of inorganic carbon were studied using the so-called homogeneous buffer factor [beta = dln(pCO(2))/dln(DIC)] (where pCO(2) is the CO2 partial pressure in surface water and DIC is dissolved inorganic carbon), which gave estimates that approximately 80% of the change in inorganic carbon was related to photosynthesis and respiration.

Cloned S. pistillata microcolonies were propagated in the laboratory from small fragments of parent colonies collected in 1990 in the Gulf of Aqaba, Jordan. Cloned microcolonies have several intrinsic properties that help to reduce unwanted biological variability: (1) same genotype; (2) similar sizes and shapes; and (3) absence of macroscopic boring organisms. Errors specifically associated with long-standing problems to do with isotopic exchange were further reduced by producing microcolonies with no skeletal surfaces exposed to the radioisotope-labelled incubation medium. The value of the technique resides principally in its superior ability to elucidate transportation pathways and processes and not in its ability to quantitatively estimate calcium deposition by corals in nature. We describe here a rapidly exchangeable calcium pool in which up to 90% of the radioactive label taken up during incubations is located. This pool (72.9 +/- 1.4 nmol Ca mg-l protein) is presumably located within the coelenteric cavity as suggested by the following: (1) it has 4-min halftime saturation kinetics; (2) the accumulation of calcium is linearly correlated with the calcium concentration of seawater; and (3) its insensitivity to metabolic and ion transport inhibitors indicate that membranes do not isolate this compartment. Washout of this large extracellular pool greatly improved estimates of calcium deposition as evidenced by 10 to 40% reduction in coefficients of variation when compared with previous Ca-45(2+) methods described in the literature. Comparisons of calcification measurements simultaneously carried out using the alkalinity anomaly technique and the Ca-45 protocol described here show that the correlation coefficient of both techniques is close to 1. Unlike previous reports, our Ca-45(2+)-derived measurements are slightly lower than those computed from the alkalinity depletion technique.","tags":null,"title":"An improved 45Ca protocol for investigating physiological mechanisms in coral calcification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J-P Gattuso","M.

Input data are: grass primary production (P-g), respiration (R), net calcification (G) and the ratio of CO2 released to CaCO3 precipitated (psi); the output is the amount of dissolved inorganic carbon (F-CO2) which needs to be exchanged with the atmosphere to balance biologically mediated changes in the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon in an open sea water system: F-CO2 = -P-g + R + psi G. Coral reef data were used in the model to illustrate the relative influence of organic and inorganic carbon metabolism on ocean-atmosphere CO2 cycling. A coral reef comprised of calcareous and non-calcareous organisms can be shown to act as a sink for atmospheric CO2 when excess (= net) production is high and CaCO3 precipitation is low. These characteristics are not typical of actively developing reef systems which typically exhibit a nearly balanced organic carbon metabolism (P-g/R approximate to 1) and relatively high rates of calcification. In these circumstances, reef communities can be expected to cause CO2 evasion to the atmosphere. This prediction is confirmed by the only existing measurement of air-sea CO2 flux in a coral reef system.","tags":null,"title":"Biological control of air-sea CO|2| fluxes: effect of photosynthetic and calcifying marine organisms and ecosystems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

The released CO2: precipitated carbonate ratio (psi) has recently been estimated to be 0.6 in seawater (taking into account the buffering capacity of the latter). We report an analytical expression enabling the computation of this ratio. Calculations show that the amount of CO2 that must be released to equilibrate seawater increases with increasing partial pressure of CO2 in seawater (pCO2), which results from human impact on atmospheric CO2. We show that at 15-degrees-C psi increased from 0.55 during the time of glaciation to 0.67 at present and would increase to 0.84 for a pCO2 of 1,000 muatm. Doubling the preindustrial pCO2 value results in a total CO2 source of approximately 5 Gt C (taking into account the described buffering effect).","tags":null,"title":"Marine calcification as a source of carbon dioxide- Positive feedback of increasing atmospheric CO|2|","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J-P Gattuso","M.

These results are compared and discussed with the few previous studies either concerning the same reef or other tropical reefs. The increase in biomass and primary production, although less marked than in other areas, may be related to nutrient enrichment either from terrestrial run-off or resuspended sediments. The predominance of diatoms seems to be a general pattern which can be related to higher growth rates of diatoms compared to other phytoplankters, thus allowing diatoms to take advantage of the nutrient enrichment in the first place. The phytoplankton increase is frequently followed by a bloom of benthic macroalgae. This micro- and macroalgal development may prevent the loss of dissolved nutrients out of the coral reef ecosystem.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of a cyclone on coral reef phytoplankton biomass, primary production and composition (Moorea island, French Polynesia)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J-P Gattuso","M.

The biomechanical properties of their skeletal structures are of great importance for their individual fitness, because the skeleton provides the means for locomotion, grazing and protection from predators. Sea urchin skeleton is composed of discrete calcite plates attached to each other at sutures by organic ligaments. The present study addressed the fate of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus (Lamarck, 1816) skeleton in acidified oceans, taking into account the combined effect of reduced pH and macroalgal diet, with potential cascading consequences at the ecosystem level. A breaking test on individual plates of juvenile specimens fed different macroalgal diets has been performed, teasing apart plate strength and stiffness from general robustness. Results showed no direct short-term effect of a decrease in seawater pH nor of the macroalgal diet on single plate mechanical properties. Nevertheless, results from apical plates, the ones presumably formed during the experimental period, provided an indication of a possible diet-mediated response, with sea urchins fed the more calcified macroalga sustaining higher forces before breakage than the one fed the non-calcified algae. This, on the long term, may produce bottom-up effects on sea urchins, leading to potential shifts in the ecosystem equilibrium under an ocean acidified scenario.","tags":null,"title":"Bottom-up effects on plate biomechanical properties of sea urchins in an acidified ocean scenario","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
