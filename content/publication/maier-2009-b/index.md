abstract = "The cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa is one of the few species able to build reef-like structures and a 3- dimensional coral framework in the deep oceans. Further- more, deep cold-water coral bioherms may be among the ﬁrst marine ecosystems to be affected by ocean acidiﬁca- tion. Colonies of L. pertusa were collected during a cruise in 2006 to cold-water coral bioherms of the Mingulay reef complex (Hebrides, North Atlantic). Shortly after sample collection onboard these corals were labelled with calcium- 45. The same experimental approach was used to assess cal- ciﬁcation rates and how those changed due to reduced pH during a cruise to the Skagerrak (North Sea) in 2007. The highest calciﬁcation rates were found in youngest polyps with up to 1% d−1 new skeletal growth and average rates of 0.11 ±0.02% d− 1 (±S.E.). Lowering pH by 0.15 and 0.3 units relative to the ambient level resulted in calciﬁcation being re- duced by 30 and 56%. Lower pH reduced calciﬁcation more in fast growing, young polyps (59% reduction) than in older polyps (40% reduction). Thus skeletal growth of young and fast calcifying corallites suffered more from ocean acidiﬁca- tion. Nevertheless, L. pertusa exhibited positive net calciﬁ- cation (as measured by 45 Ca incorporation) even at an arag- onite saturation state (􏰇)) below 1."
