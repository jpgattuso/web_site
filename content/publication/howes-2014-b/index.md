abstract = "The widespread distribution of pteropods, their role in ocean food webs, and their sensitivity to ocean warming and acidification has renewed scientific interest in this zooplanktonic group. Their delicate structure, sensitivity to handling and issues surrounding buoyancy and feeding make thecosome pteropods notoriously difficult to maintain in the laboratory, causing high mortality rates and unnatural behaviours that may confound experimental findings. Mortality rate also restricts the use of acclimation periods to experimental conditions and impede vital long-term studies. Here we summarise the current status of culture methodology to provide a comprehensive basis for future experimental work and culture system development."
