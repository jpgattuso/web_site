abstract = "We show here that CO 2partial pressure (pCO 2) and temperature significantly interact on coral physiology. The effects of increased pCO 2and temperature on photosynthesis, respiration and calcification rates were investigated in the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata. Cuttings were exposed to temperatures of 25°C or 28°C and to pCO 2values of ca. 460 or 760 atm for 5 weeks. The contents of chlorophyll c2and protein remained constant throughout the experiment, while the chlorophyll acontent was significantly affected by temperature, and was higher under the ‘high-temperature-high- pCO 2’ condition. The cell-specific density was higher at ‘high pCO 2’ than at ‘normal pCO 2’ (1.7 vs. 1.4). The net photosynthesis normalized per unit protein was affected by both temperature and pCO 2, whereas respiration was not affected by the treatments. Calcification decreased by 50% when temperature and pCO 2were both elevated. Calcification under normal temperature did not change in response to an increased pCO 2. This is not in agreement with numerous published papers that describe a negative relationship between marine calcification and CO 2. The confounding effect of temperature has the potential to explain a large portion of the variability of the relationship between calcification and pCO 2reported in the literature, and warrants a re-evaluation of the projected decrease of marine calcification by the year 2100."
