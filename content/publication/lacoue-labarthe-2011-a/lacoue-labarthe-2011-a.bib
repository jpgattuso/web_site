 abstract = {The anthropogenic release of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere leads to an increase in the CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) in the ocean, which may reach 950 ppmv at the end of the 21st century. The resulting hypercapnia (high pCO2) and decreasing pH ("ocean acidification") may be expected to have appreciable effects on water-breathing organisms, especially on their early life stages. For organisms like squid that lay their eggs in coastal areas where the embryo and then paralarvae also exposed to metallic contamination, there is a need for information on how ocean acidification may influence their bioaccumulation. In this study, we investigated the effects of increased levels of pCO2 (380, 850 and 500 ppmv corresponding to pHT of 8.1, 7.85 and 7.60) on the accumulation of dissolved 110mAg, 109Cd, 57Co, 203Hg, 54Mn and 65Zn in the whole egg strand and in the different egg compartments during the whole period of development and in the hatchlings during their first days of the paralarval life. In the embryo, increasing seawater pCO2 enhanced the uptake of 110mAg and 65Zn and 203Hg showed a minimal concentration factor (CF) at 850 ppmv. The incorporation of 65Zn in statoliths increased with increasing pCO2 following its enhanced metal uptake in the whole body of the embryo and also with the greater size of the statoliths that occurred with their exposure to 850 and 1500 ppmv, compared to 380 ppmv. The more 110mAg, 203Hg and 65Zn accumulated in the embryo, the lower were their CF values in the eggshell, suggesting that the retention properties of the eggshell were affected by pCO2. The uptake of 109Cd and 54Mn in embryo and the eggshell decreased as a function of increasing pCO2 and the accumulation of 57Co in embryos was not affected by the pCO2 conditions. After 52 h of exposure, the steady-state equilibrium value of 110mAg CF in paralarvae increased with increasing pCO2, while the CF for 57Co was reduced at 1500 ppmv. As observed in the eggshell, 203Hg in paralarvae showed a maximal uptake rate at 850 ppmv whereas the uptake of 54Mn and 65Zn was not significantly modified by hypercapnic conditions. These results suggest a combined effect of pH on the adsorption and protective properties of the eggshell and of hypercapnia on the metabolism of embryo and paralarvae, both modifying the accumulation of particular metals in the biological tissues of Loligo vulgaris.},
