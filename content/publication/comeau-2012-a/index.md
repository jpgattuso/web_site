abstract = "Pteropods are planktonic mollusks that play an important role in the food web of var- ious ecosystems, particularly at high latitudes. Because they produce an aragonitic shell, ptero- pods are expected to be very sensitive to ocean acidification driven by anthropogenic CO2 emis- sions. The effect of ocean acidification was investigated using juveniles of the Arctic pteropod Limacina helicina from the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean. The animals were maintained in 3 controlled pH conditions (total scale pH [pHT] Ùè∞§ 8.05, 7.90 or 7.75) for 8 d, and their mortality and the linear extension of their shell were monitored. The pH did not impact the mortality rate, but the linear extension of the shell decreased as a function of declining pH. Surprisingly, the ptero- pods were still able to extend their shell at an aragonite saturation state as low as 0.6. Neverthe- less, dissolution marks were visible on the whole shell, indicating that calcium carbonate dissolution had also occurred, casting doubts on the ability of the pteropods to maintain a positive balance between precipitation and dissolution of calcium carbonate under corrosive conditions."
