 abstract = {Previous studies have shown that increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration affects calcification in most planktonic calcifiers. Both reduced1 or stimulated2 calcification under high CO2 have been reported in the widespread coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi. This might affect the response of cells to photosynthetic active (PAR; 400-700 nm) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR; 280-400 nm) by altering the thickness of the coccolith layer. Here we show that in the absence of UVR, the calcification rates in E. huxleyi decrease under lowered pH levels (pHNBS of 7.9 and 7.6; pCO2 of 804 and 1759 ppmv) leading to thinned coccolith layers, while photosynthetic carbon fixation remained unaffected. Exposure to UVR in addition to PAR however, results in significant inhibition of both photosynthesis and calcification and these rates are further inhibited with increasing acidification. The combined effects of UVR and seawater acidification result in the inhibition of calcification rates by 96% and 99% and that of photosynthesis by 6% and 15%, at pH 7.9 and 7.6, respectively. This differential inhibition of calcification (C) and photosynthesis (P) leads to significant reduction of the C/P ratio. Seawater acidification enhances the transmission of harmful UVR by about 26% through a reduction of the coccolith layer of 32%. Our data indicate that the impact of a high CO2/low pH ocean on E. huxleyi (due to reduced calcification associated with changes in the carbonate system) enhances the detrimental effects of UVR on the major pelagic calcifier.},
