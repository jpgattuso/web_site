abstract = "The mesopelagic (\"twilight\") zone of the ocean is the sandwich layer between euphotic surface waters and the deep ocean. The physical, chemical and biological processes in this layer strongly influence the marine carbon cycle; however, there are surprising knowledge gaps e.g. with respect to microbial communities. Thus, biological parameters such as microbial abun- dances, community respiration, and bacterial and archaeal community composition (as assessed by 16S rRNA gene PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis [DGGE]) were determined dur- ing a seasonal study (at ca. 46d intervals for 433d) at a coastal mesopelagic site (Point C, 300m depth, NW Mediterranean Sea) and related to physico-chemical parameters. Some chemical and most biological parameters showed a strong variability thus, confirming the emerging view that this water layer is more dynamic than previously thought. Community respiration was likely in- fluenced by seasonal changes as indicated by its indirect relationship with water stratification. Also, the high detected community respiration rates confirm that the the twilight zone plays a critical role as hub between surface and deep water. Correlation analyses indicate that dissolved organic carbon and transparent organic particles were controlling factors of bacterial community composition, whereas the archaeal community was likely controlled by other mechanisms. A se- quence analysis of DGGE bands and a literature comparison suggests some specificity of the mesopelagic zone regarding bacterial and archaeal community composition thus, further con- firming the peculiarity of this water layer."
