abstract = "Larvae of the Mediterranean pteropod Cavolinia inXexa were maintained at controlled pHT values of 8.1, 7.82 and 7.51, equivalent, respectively, to pCO2 levels of 380, 857 and 1,713 Ùè∞üatm. At pHT 7.82, larvae exhibited malformations and lower shell growth, compared to the control condition. At pHT 7.51, the larvae did not make shells but were viable and showed a normal development. However, smaller shells or no shells will have both ecolog- ical (food web) and biogeochemical (export of carbon and carbonate) consequences. These results suggest that ptero- pod larvae, as well as the species dependent upon them or upon adults as a food resource, might be signiWcantly impacted by ocean acidiWcation."
