 abstract = {Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions simultaneously cause ocean warming and
acidification, impacting marine calcifying species. This study investigated the effect of
elevated seawater pCO2 (i.e. pH 8.10, 7.85 and 7.60 and temperature 16 and 19°C)
on (i) the abiotic conditions in the fluid surrounding the embryo (viz. the perivitelline
fluid), (ii) growth, development and (iii) cuttlebone calcification of embryonic and
juvenile stages of the cephalopod Sepia officinalis. Egg swelling raised in response to
acidified treatment, leading to an increase of the egg surface. Embryos experienced
extreme abiotic conditions in the perivitelline fluid: in late developmental stages, the
fluid pCO2 was more than 3-fold higher than in seawater pCO2 and always
disadvantageous to aragonite precipitation, even under control conditions (i.e. Ωar <
1). Growth of both embryos and juveniles was unaffected by pH, whereas 45Ca
incorporation in cuttlebone increased significantly with decreasing pH. This
hypercalcification in response to ocean acidification could impair cuttlebone buoyancy
function and ultimately cuttlefish survival.},
