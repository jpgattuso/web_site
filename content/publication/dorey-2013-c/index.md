abstract = "Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions simultaneously cause ocean warming andacidification, impacting marine calcifying species. This study investigated the effect ofelevated seawater pCO2 (i.e. pH 8.10, 7.85 and 7.60 and temperature 16 and 19°C)on (i) the abiotic conditions in the fluid surrounding the embryo (viz. the perivitellinefluid), (ii) growth, development and (iii) cuttlebone calcification of embryonic andjuvenile stages of the cephalopod Sepia officinalis. Egg swelling raised in response toacidified treatment, leading to an increase of the egg surface. Embryos experiencedextreme abiotic conditions in the perivitelline fluid: in late developmental stages, thefluid pCO2 was more than 3-fold higher than in seawater pCO2 and alwaysdisadvantageous to aragonite precipitation, even under control conditions (i.e. Ωar <1). Growth of both embryos and juveniles was unaffected by pH, whereas 45Caincorporation in cuttlebone increased significantly with decreasing pH. Thishypercalcification in response to ocean acidification could impair cuttlebone buoyancyfunction and ultimately cuttlefish survival."
