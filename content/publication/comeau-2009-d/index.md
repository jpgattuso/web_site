abstract = "Thecosome pteropods (shelled pelagic molluscs) can play an important role in the food web of various ecosys- tems and play a key role in the cycling of carbon and car- bonate. Since they harbor an aragonitic shell, they could be very sensitive to ocean acidiﬁcation driven by the increase of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The impact of changes in the carbonate chemistry was investigated on Limacina helic- ina, a key species of Arctic ecosystems. Pteropods were kept in culture under controlled pH conditions corresponding to pCO2 levels of 350 and 760 µatm. Calciﬁcation was esti- mated using a ﬂuorochrome and the radioisotope 45 Ca. It exhibits a 28% decrease at the pH value expected for 2100 compared to the present pH value. This result supports the concern for the future of pteropods in a high-CO2 world, as well as of those species dependent upon them as a food re- source. A decline of their populations would likely cause dramatic changes to the structure, function and services of polar ecosystems."
